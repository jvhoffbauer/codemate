    Create an invoice.

    This will (let's imagine) let the API user (some external developer) create an
    invoice.

    And this path operation will:

    * Send the invoice to the client.
    * Collect the money from the client.
    * Send a notification back to the API user (the external developer), as a callback.
        * At this point is that the API will somehow send a POST request to the
            external API with the notification of the invoice event
            (e.g. "payment successful").
