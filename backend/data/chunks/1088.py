                By default, if no HTTP Auhtorization header is provided, required for
                OpenID Connect authentication, it will automatically cancel the request
                and send the client an error.

                If `auto_error` is set to `False`, when the HTTP Authorization header
                is not available, instead of erroring out, the dependency result will
