- Updates a specific item's (represented by `obj`) fields with new values from a dictionary (`values`) using the model's metadata (`self.model`) to determine which fields are valid updates. - Supports updating both simple fields and nested relational attributes by recursively calling itself on any nested dictionaries found within the value being updated. - Does not attempt to update non-existent or invalid fields, instead continuing onto the next key/value pair.
