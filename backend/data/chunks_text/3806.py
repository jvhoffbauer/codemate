- This function is a unit test for making an HTTP GET request using the `TestClient` from the `pytest-httpx` plugin. - It takes three arguments: URL to make the request against, optional query parameters as a dictionary (`data`), and a `TestClient` instance that provides a mockable HTTP server. - The function makes the GET request with the provided URL and any data, stores the response in a variable called `response`, and then performs two assertions on it: first, checks if the status code of the response is equal to 200; second, compares the JSON representation of the response body with the expected result passed as `data`.
