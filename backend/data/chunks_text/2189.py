- Defines a function `get_scope_counter()` that takes three arguments with default values provided by Pydantic's `Security` decorator for dependency injection and security checks. - The first argument `count` is assigned to the `dep_counter` dependency without any additional restrictions or permissions. - The second and third arguments `scope_count_1` and `scope_count_2`, respectively, are also assigned to the `dep_counter` dependency but only when accessing resources protected by the `"scope"` permission. This allows fine-grained control over which dependencies can be accessed in specific contexts based on user authorization levels.
