- This test checks if a FastAPIError is raised when trying to access an invalid response model (in this case, tutorial003_04_py310) in the `docs_src` folder of the project. - The `with pytest.raises()` context manager is used to raise and catch exceptions during testing. - If the exception is not caught, it will be propagated up the call stack until it's handled or reaches the main thread, causing the test to fail.
