- This endpoint is accessed using GET request to `http://localhost:8000/items/`.
- It returns an instance of `CommonsDep`, which provides access to common resources like database connections and logging utilities.
- The `read_items()` function doesn't actually retrieve any items, but rather demonstrates how to pass a dependency (in this case, `CommonsDep`) into a FastAPI route handler as a parameter.
