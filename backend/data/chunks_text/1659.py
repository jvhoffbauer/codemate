- Defines an asynchronous function `get_db` that returns a database session using SQLAlchemy's `DBSession`. - Uses a context manager with a `try...finally` block to automatically close the database connection after it is used by other parts of the application. - Yields the open database session, allowing it to be used in subsequent asynchronous functions without blocking or creating multiple connections.
