- Defines a function `decorator` that takes in a type parameter `model`, which is expected to be a subclass of Pydantic's TableModel class. - Inside the function, it sets the value of the private attribute `__pydantic_model__` on the input `model` object to the value of the variable `schema`. This allows us to pass custom validation logic to Pydantic by providing our own Schema instance instead of using the default one generated from the model's fields. - The decorated model can now use this custom validation logic when validating itself or its data. By returning the original `model` type, we preserve the original functionality and behavior while adding the new feature of custom validation through the provided Schema instance.
