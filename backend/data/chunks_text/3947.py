- This function tests the `/items/` endpoint with no search query parameters (i.e., an empty string or `None`) using Flask's built-in testing client. - The expected HTTP status code is checked against the actual response received from the server. - If the status code matches the expectation, the JSON response body is also verified to contain a dictionary with a key named 'q', whose value should be `None`.
