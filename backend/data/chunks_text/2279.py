- Returns a dictionary with three `Item` objects as values, where some fields are excluded from serialization based on their presence in the `response_model_exclude_unset` parameter. - The `response_model` parameter specifies that the returned value should be serialized using the `Dict[str, Item]` type annotation, which is equivalent to a dictionary of strings (keys) and `Item` instances (values). - The `response_model_exclude_unset` parameter is set to `True`, indicating that any unset or nullable fields in the `Item` class should not be included in the JSON output by default. This can help reduce unnecessary data transfer and improve performance for large datasets.
