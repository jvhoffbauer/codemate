- Defines a new `route_create` method that returns an asynchronous function called `route`. This function is used to define a specific HTTP endpoint (in this case, it's likely creating a new resource).
- The `route` function takes three arguments: `Request`, which represents the incoming HTTP request; `link_id`, which is a list of ID strings representing links; and `item_id`, which is a list of IDs representing items. These parameters are passed through using FastAPI's query string parsing feature.
- Firstly, we check whether the user has permission to update resources by calling `has_update_permission` on our parent class `PKAdmin`. If they don't have permission, we return an error message.
- We then create an empty list called `values` where we will store key-value pairs for each link-item relationship being created. For each item in `item_id`, we parse its Python data type using `get_python_type_parse` and add it to `values`.
- Next, we iterate over each link ID from `parser_str_set_list` (which converts a comma-separated string into a set) and again use `get_python_type_parse` to convert them into their corresponding Python types. We then add these keys and values to `values`.
- Finally, we construct an SQL INSERT statement with all the necessary columns and values, execute it using `async_execute`, and return a response object containing the number of rows affected.
