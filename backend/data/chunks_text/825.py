- This function is an asynchronous decorator that checks whether a given `refresh_token` is valid and returns its corresponding data from the database. - It takes a single argument, `refresh_token`, which is retrieved from a cookie with the name "refreshToken". - The function first calls the `service.get_refresh_token()` method to retrieve the token's record from the database. If it doesn't exist or has expired, it raises a custom exception called `RefreshTokenNotValid`. - After verifying the existence of the token in the database, the function checks whether it's still valid using another helper function named `_is_valid_refresh_token()`. If it fails this check, it also raises `RefreshTokenNotValid`. - Finally, the function returns the token's data (presumably including user information).
