- This method is an asynchronous function called before filtering a resource's attributes based on user input (i.e., query parameters). - It first calls the parent class' `on_filter_pre` method to obtain the filtered data and stores it in the variable `data`. - If `data` is empty, this method returns without doing anything else. - Otherwise, it retrieves a list of fields that should be excluded from the filter using the `get_deny_fields` helper method provided by FastAPI. The argument passed to this method specifies which type of denial we are dealing with ("filter" in our case). - Finally, it creates a dictionary containing all key-value pairs from `data`, but excluding any keys found in the `exclude` list obtained earlier.
