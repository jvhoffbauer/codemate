- Defines a method `__eq__()` for the `Entrypoint` class to implement the equality operator (`==`) between two instances of this class. - Checks if the argument passed to the method is also an instance of the `Entrypoint` class using the built-in function `isinstance()`. - If both objects are instances of `Entrypoint`, compares their `routes` attribute values using the assignment operator (`=`) to determine whether they're equal or not.
