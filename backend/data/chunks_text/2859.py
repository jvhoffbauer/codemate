- Tests whether `Query()` with an empty list as argument returns a string representation that matches the expected format (i.e., `Query([])`) using the built-in Python function `assert`. - The test is named `test_query_repr_list`, indicating its purpose and scope, which helps in organizing tests and making them easier to find later on.
