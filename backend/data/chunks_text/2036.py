- This function is called by `MkDocs` to handle resolving file paths for documentation pages. - It takes three arguments: an optional keyword argument `item`, which represents the name of the page being requested; a required positional argument `files`, which is a list used to store information about the resolved files; and a required positional argument `config`, which contains configuration options for `MkDocs`. - If the specified page doesn't exist in its expected location, this function searches for it in a parent directory named "en" that should contain English translations or alternative versions of the same content. - The found file is added to the `files` list with some additional metadata, including its original filename, the path to its source directory, and whether URLs should be relative to directories instead of just the root site URL.
