- Defines an asynchronous context manager using `@contextlib.asynccontextmanager`.
- Creates a dictionary called `_calls` to store information about requests and responses.
- Inside the context manager, saves request and response data along with any exceptions that occur during execution in `_calls`.
- Raises a `RuntimeError` at the end of the context manager to simulate an exception being thrown. This error is caught by the caller of this function.
- The unique marker `unique_marker` is used to ensure that the raised exception is not swallowed by Python's default exception handling mechanism.
