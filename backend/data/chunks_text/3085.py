- This function is a FastAPI endpoint with the `@app.post` decorator, which handles HTTP POST requests to the URL path "/people/"
- The request body is parsed using the `PersonCreate` model and assigned to the variable `person`.
- A new `Person` object is created from the `Person` ORM (object relational mapping) class by passing in the `person` dictionary as an argument to its constructor.
- The newly created `Person` object is returned as the API response, converted to the `PersonRead` model using the `response_model` parameter of the `@app.post` decorator.
