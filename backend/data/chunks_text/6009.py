- Defines a fixture named `admin_cls_list` that returns a tuple containing two classes: `UserAdmin`, which is a subclass of Django's built-in `ModelAdmin` for managing instances of the `User` model, and `BlogApp`, which is an instance of Django's `AdminApp` class used to group related administrative interfaces together. - The `BlogApp` constructor takes an existing `AdminApp` object as input (which represents the overall Django administration interface), and registers the `UserAdmin` class with it using the `register_admin()` method provided by Django's `AdminSite`. This ensures that users will be able to manage their accounts through the main Django administration site, rather than having to navigate to a separate location or application.
