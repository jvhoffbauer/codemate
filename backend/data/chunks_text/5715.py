- Retrieves and returns the page schema associated with this object, which is used to define the structure of a specific type of content in a web application. - Checks whether the `page_schema` attribute already exists on the object; if it does, converts it into an instance of `PageSchema` if necessary, sets its label property if not set yet, and returns it. - Raises a `TypeError` exception if the `page_schema` value has an unexpected data type.
