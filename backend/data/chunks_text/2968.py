- Defines an asynchronous function `get_async_callable_gen_dependency()`.
- Takes a positional argument `value` with default value provided by another dependency called `async_callable_gen_dependency`.
- Returns the value of the `value` parameter, which can be used in other functions that depend on this one. The use of `Depends()` decorator ensures that the dependency is resolved before executing the function body.
