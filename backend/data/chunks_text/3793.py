- Tests if a GET request to "/portal" with parameter "teleport" returns a temporary redirect (HTTP status code 307) and sets the location header to a specific YouTube video URL ("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ") without automatically following the redirection. - Uses Flask's built-in `client` object for testing purposes instead of making requests directly through HTTP libraries like Requests or urllib2. - Asserts that the expected behavior is met by checking both the response status code and headers using Python's unittest framework.
