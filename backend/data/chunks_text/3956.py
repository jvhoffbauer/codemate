- Generates an OpenAPI v3.1 JSON schema for a FastAPI application using `pytest` and `fastapi`.
- The generated schema includes information about endpoints (e.g., GET request to retrieve items), responses (including error codes like HTTP validation errors), parameters (such as query string arguments), and data types used in requests and responses.
- The schema is organized into sections such as paths, components, and schemas, with clear definitions of each element's purpose and structure.
