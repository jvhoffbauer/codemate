- Defines a GET request for retrieving information about a specific dataset using FastAPI's `@app.get()` decorator and specifies the endpoint URL (`/info`)
- Specifies that the response will be in JSON format using `response_class=JSONResponse`, and excludes None values from being included in the response using `response_model_exclude_None=True`. The expected response model is defined by `response_model=Info`.
- Dependencies are passed to the function through arguments, including `src_path`, which represents the path of the input file; `bands_params` and `reader_params`, which contain parameters related to reading the data; and `env`, which contains environment variables used during execution. These dependencies are obtained using functions provided by the application, such as `self.path_dependency`, `self.bands_dependency`, `self.reader_dependency`, and `self.environment_dependency`.
- Inside the function body, the `rasterio.Env` object is created based on the `env` dependency, and then the specified dataset is opened using the `self.reader()` method, passing the `src_path` and `reader_params` dependencies. The resulting dataset is then queried using the `info()` method, passing the `bands_params` dependency, and the result is returned as the API response.
