- Defines an asynchronous function `retrieve_user` that takes an integer argument `id`.
- Uses the `ORMUser` class to fetch a specific user from the database with ID `id`, and stores it in a variable called `user`.
- Converts the fetched `ORMUser` object into a regular `User` object using the `from_orm()` method, which is then returned by the function.
