1. Defines a function `create_heroes` that creates three new heroes and saves them to the database using SQLAlchemy's ORM.
2. Creates three instances of the `Hero` class, passing in arguments for their names, secret identities, and ages where applicable.
3. Begins a transaction with the current engine instance using an autocommit context manager provided by SQLAlchemy.
4. Adds each newly created hero object to the session, which will be persisted when the commit is called at step 5.
5. Commits the changes made during this session to the underlying database connection.
6. Explicitly returns from the function since we don't need anything else here.
