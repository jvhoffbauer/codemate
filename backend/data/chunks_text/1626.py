- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()` that takes a dependency of type `Annotated[CommonQueryParams, Depends(CommonQueryParams)]`. This is used to pass query parameters from the request URL into the function. - Initializes an empty dictionary called `response`. - Checks if the `q` parameter (a search term) is present in the query params and adds it to the `response` dictionary. - Retrieves a list of items from a mock database using slice notation based on the values of `commons.skip` and `commons.limit`, which are also passed in through the query params. - Adds the retrieved items to the `response` dictionary and returns it.
