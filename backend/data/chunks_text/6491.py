- This function updates references to schemas within a JSON object or array based on a mapping of old schema names to their corresponding new ones. - It recursively traverses through lists and dictionaries to find any '$ref' keys that contain an old schema name. - If found, it replaces the old schema name with its equivalent from the provided mapping, prefixed by a custom prefix REF_PREFIX.
