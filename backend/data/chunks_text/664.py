- Defines a function `set_transaction_id` that takes a string argument `correlation_id`.
- Sets the transaction ID for an event using the `configure_scope` context manager provided by Sentry SDK.
- Adds a tag named "transaction_id" to the event's scope with the value of the passed `correlation_id`. This allows easy correlation between logs and Sentry events.
