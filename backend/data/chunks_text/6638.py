- Tests middleware without authentication by making a request with no authorization headers and verifying that it returns a 401 Unauthorized status code and an error message in the response body. - Uses `raw_request` from Flask's testing utilities to simulate a client request without executing the application logic or database queries. - Asserts that the response status code is 401 and the JSON response contains the expected error detail using Pytest's built-in assertions.
