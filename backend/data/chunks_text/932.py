- This method is called `errors()` and returns a sequence (e.g., list, tuple) of any type (represented by the `Any` type hint). - The sequence being returned comes from an attribute named `_errors`, which suggests it's a private implementation detail that should not be accessed directly outside this class. - In summary, this method provides a way to retrieve all error objects associated with this object in one go, potentially for debugging or logging purposes.
