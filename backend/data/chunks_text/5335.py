- This function, named `_assets_bidx`, takes an optional parameter `params` of type `Dependencies[AssetsBidxParams]`. It returns this parameter without any modifications (i.e., it's a simple pass-through).
- The `Dependencies` class is used to manage dependencies between functions in FastAPI applications. In this case, we are using it to ensure that the `AssetsBidxParams` object is available when calling this function.
- The `AssetsBidxParams` object contains parameters related to asset prices and dividend yields, which can be used by other functions in our application. By returning these parameters as part of the response, they become easily accessible for further processing or display.
