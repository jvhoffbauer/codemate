- This function is used to roll back database changes made during development using Alembic, a SQL migration tool for Python.
- The `downgrade()` function contains a list of SQL statements that reverse the effects of previous migrations. These statements are automatically generated by Alembic and should be adjusted as necessary.
- In this example, the function drops several indexes and tables from the "item" and "user" tables in the database.
