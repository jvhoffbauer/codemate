- This function `info()` returns basic information about a raster dataset using the provided dependencies for path, band selection, and environment variables. - It uses the `rasterio` library to open the dataset at the specified location (`src_path`) with customized parameters from the `reader_params`, `bands_params`, and `env` arguments. - The resulting dataset is then passed through the `info()` method of the opened file handle (`src_dst`) to extract its metadata, which are returned by this function.
