- Tests if a view function without `@app.route`, `@api.route`, or any other decorator that specifies a URL returns an exact dictionary as JSON response when no model is used for serialization. - Sends a GET request to the specified endpoint using Flask's built-in testing client (client). - Asserts that the HTTP status code of the response is 200 and saves its text in case of failure. - Unpacks the JSON data from the response body and compares it with a predefined dictionary containing the expected values.
