- Defines an asynchronous function called `overrider_dependency_with_sub` that takes a single argument, `msg`, which is passed to it using the `Depends()` decorator with the `overrider_sub_dependency` dependency. - The returned value of this function replaces the original dependency in the route where it's used. - This allows for more fine-grained control and customization of dependencies at specific routes without modifying the original implementation or creating new dependencies.
