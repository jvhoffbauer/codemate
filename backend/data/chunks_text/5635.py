- This method is a private helper function called `_create_schema_list`.
- It returns an instance of the type `SchemaListT`, which is defined as part of the class's generic parameters (i.e., `Type[SchemaListT]`).
- The specific implementation simply returns the value assigned to the `schema_model` attribute, implying that this variable holds the desired schema list type for use in the class.
