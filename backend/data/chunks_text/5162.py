- Defines an endpoint for retrieving geospatial data in GeoJSON format (`.geojson`) using FastAPI and RasterIO libraries. - The `@self.router.get()` decorator is used to define a GET request handler that returns a JSON object representing a GeoJSON feature. - The `response_model`, `response_model_exclude_none`, and `response_class` parameters are set to specify the expected output format and class. - A dictionary containing HTTP status codes and corresponding descriptions is passed to the `responses` parameter to provide detailed error messages. - Three dependencies (`self.path_dependency`, `self.reader_dependency`, and `self.environment_dependency`) are injected into the function using the `Depends()` decorator provided by FastAPI. These dependencies allow access to various resources required to process the requested data. - Within the function body, a context manager from RasterIO is created to manage the environment variables needed to read the input file. - Using the `rasterio.Reader()` method, the input file is opened and its metadata is extracted using the `info()` method. This information is then returned as a GeoJSON feature consisting of a polygon geometry and associated properties.
