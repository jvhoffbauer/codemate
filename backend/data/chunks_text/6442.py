- Defines an `async` function called `_handle_exception` that takes a boolean argument `reraise`. - Inside this function, it uses a `try...except` block to catch any exceptions raised by the `yield` expression. - If the caught exception is different from the current instance of `self.exception`, it tries to handle the exception using the entrypoint's `handle_exception()` method. - If the handled response is available, it passes it to the `on_raw_response()` callback; otherwise, it raises the original exception. - After handling all possible exceptions, it checks whether there are still unhandled exceptions left in the stack trace. - Finally, it logs the error message with the help of the `logger` object provided by FastAPI.
