- Tests the `UserCrud` class from SQLAlchemyCore to generate a CRUD API and register it with FastAPI's routers using Pydantic's BaseModel for input validation. - Verifies that the generated OpenAPI documentation excludes sensitive fields (such as passwords) from the list response schema. - Makes an HTTP request to retrieve a list of users from the registered endpoint and checks that the returned data is correct, including the expected fields and absence of excluded ones.
