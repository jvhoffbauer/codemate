- Imports a function `client` from another module in the project's documentation sources (docs_src) for testing purposes. - Makes an HTTP GET request to the URL "/users/" using the imported `client`. - Asserts that the status code of the response is 200 and saves its text for debugging purposes if necessary. - Extracts the JSON data returned by the server and asserts that it contains specific keys ("message" and "params").
