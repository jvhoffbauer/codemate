- Removes a child with the given `unique_id` from this group or subgroup's list of children. - First removes the direct child with the specified ID from the current object's internal list of children (`_children`) using list comprehension and filtering based on the uniqueness condition. - Then recursively calls itself to propagate the removal request down the hierarchy by passing the same `unique_id` argument to each child that is an instance of `AdminGroup`. This ensures consistency across all levels of the directory structure.
