- Defines an endpoint at `/point/{lon},{lat}` that returns a Point object in JSON format using FastAPI's dependency injection mechanism to pass parameters and dependencies between functions. - The function takes several arguments including longitude (lon) and latitude (lat) coordinates, as well as various parameter and dependency objects passed through the Depends decorator from other functions. - Inside the function, it uses RasterIO library to read the data from the specified location based on the provided parameters and dependencies, and then returns a dictionary containing the requested values and metadata.
