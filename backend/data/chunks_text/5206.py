- Defines an endpoint for retrieving a list of supported bands using FastAPI's `@app.get()` decorator and Pydantic's `response_model`. - Specifies that the method returns a list of strings (i.e., band names). - Includes a description in the HTTP response body to provide more context about what the API call is doing. - Dependencies are passed into the function via FastAPI's dependency injection system, which allows us to reuse common functionality across multiple endpoints without repeating ourselves.
