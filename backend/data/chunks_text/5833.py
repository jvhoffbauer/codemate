- Generates an Amis (Alibaba Cloud Mobile Intelligence Studio) form based on a PyDantic model
- Takes three arguments: the model class, whether to set defaults, and whether it's a filter form
- Sets up the basic properties of the form, including title and size
- Loops through all fields in the model using `model_fields`, generating a single form item for each one with optional default setting and filter flag passed down
