- Creates a function `create_heroes` that initializes three new instances of the `Hero` class and sets their attributes (names, secret names for two heroes, and an additional attribute `age` for one hero). - Uses SQLAlchemy's `Session` context manager to add these objects to the database and commit the changes.
