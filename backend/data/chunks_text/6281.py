- This function is a pytest mark for asynchronous tests using the `aiohttp` library's client session.
- It uses parameterized testing with PyTest to test different combinations of query parameters and their corresponding HTTP status codes.
- The function makes an API request using the `async_api_client` object provided by PyTest fixtures, passing in the specified query parameters.
- The response is printed along with its JSON content for debugging purposes.
- Finally, the actual HTTP status code is checked against the expected value.
