- This function tests creating a new schedule with additional fields (`start_datetime`, `end_datetime`, `repeat_at`, and `process_after`) using the `PUT /items/{item_id}` endpoint. - The `expected_response` dictionary is created by copying the input `data` and adding calculated values for `start_process` and `duration`. - The actual response from the server is compared to the expected response using Pytest's built-in assertions.
