- Defines a class method `get_resp_model` that returns an instance of the response model for this API endpoint. - Checks whether the `resp_model` attribute already exists on the current class, and returns it if so to avoid redundant instantiation. - If `resp_model` doesn't exist yet, creates it by calling another method (presumably defined in the same class) called `build_resp_model`.
