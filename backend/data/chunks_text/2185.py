- Defines a function `get_sub_counter` that takes two dependencies as arguments: `subcount` from `Depends(super_dep)`, and `count` from `Depends(dep_counter)`. - The returned value is a dictionary with keys 'counter' (value of `count`) and'subcounter' (value of `subcount`). - This function can be used to provide both `count` and `subcount` values to another function or view using dependency injection in FastAPI.
