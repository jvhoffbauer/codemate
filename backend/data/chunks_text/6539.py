- This function takes a dictionary `obj` as input and recursively applies itself to any nested dictionaries it contains. - It removes the 'default' key from objects that have both 'const' and 'default'. - It checks whether the value of the 'openapi' key is compatible with the versions supported by this library (stored in `supported_openapi_versions`) and replaces it with a more general type (ANY).
