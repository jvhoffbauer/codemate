- Defines a function `model_config` that takes a type of BaseModel as an argument (`model`) and returns either its class or a dictionary containing configuration options for the model. - The returned value can be either the original model class itself (i.e., just returning `model`) or a customized dictionary with specific configurations to override default values in the model's constructor. This allows for more flexibility when initializing multiple instances of the same model with different settings.
