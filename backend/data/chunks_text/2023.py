- This function handles PUT requests to update or create an item with a specific ID (item_id). - It takes two optional parameters `name` and `size`, which can be passed as query params or request body using FastAPI's `Body()` decorator. - If the item already exists in the dictionary `items`, its properties are updated; otherwise, it is created and added to the dictionary. - The response status code is set based on whether the item was found or not.
