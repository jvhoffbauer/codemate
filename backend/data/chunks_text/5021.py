- Defines a class method `create()` for creating an instance of this class with a preconfigured Redis connection pool using AsyncIORedis library and settings from the `settings.py` file. - The `async` decorator is used to make it asynchronous, allowing multiple requests to be handled concurrently without blocking each other. - The `await` keyword is used to wait for the initialization of the Redis connection pool before returning the new object.
