- Tests if calling a synchronous endpoint that raises an AsyncDependencyError results in the error being raised and the asynchronous endpoint not executing. - Verifies that the asynchronous endpoint is still marked as finalized, indicating it was never executed due to the synchronous error. - Clears the errors dictionary after checking its contents to ensure it doesn't interfere with future tests.
