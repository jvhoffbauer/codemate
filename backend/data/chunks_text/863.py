- Defines a method named 'add_task' that takes a function (`func`) as its argument along with optional positional arguments (*args) and keyword arguments (**kwargs), both of which are passed on to the wrapped function.
- The type hint for `func` specifies that it should be a callable object that accepts parameters specified by `P`. This allows us to pass any function with compatible signature to this method.
- The documentation string provided for `func` explains what kind of functions can be passed to this method - they could either be plain Python functions or coroutines marked with `async def`.
- Finally, the method returns the result of calling the parent class's equivalent method ('add_task') with the same arguments.
