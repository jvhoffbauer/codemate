- Creates a context manager fixture called `mock_client_session`.
- Replaces the global variable `httputils.CLIENT_SESSION` with an `AsyncMock` instance during the execution of tests inside this fixture.
- Defines a new method `mocked_session_get` for the `AsyncMock` object, which will be used to replace the behavior of the original `ClientSession.get()` method.
- Cleans up by deleting the modified `httputils.CLIENT_SESSION` after the test is completed.
