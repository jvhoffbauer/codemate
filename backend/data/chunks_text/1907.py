- This function is a PATCH endpoint for updating an existing item with ID `item_id`.
- The request body contains a new representation of the item to be updated (`item`) in JSON format.
- The function retrieves the current data and model of the item from the dictionary `items`, which serves as a simple database.
- It then merges the incoming updates into the old model using the `copy()` method provided by pydantic's `BaseModel`.
- Finally, it replaces the original entry in `items` with the updated version encoded as JSON.
- The updated item is returned as the response.
