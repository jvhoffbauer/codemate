- Tests if GET request to path "/path/param-ge/<int:id>" with parameter "id" greater than or equal to 42 returns a JSON response of value 42 and HTTP status code 200. - Uses Flask's built-in `client` object for making requests against our app, which is equivalent to sending an actual HTTP request over the network. - Asserts that the expected HTTP status code (200) and JSON response are returned by the server using Pytest's `assert` statement.
