- Tests if Flask-RESTful returns a `Response` object with status code 200 and plain text body when no response model annotation is provided for a resource method that doesn't return any specific data type (in this case, just a string). - Uses the built-in `client` object to simulate HTTP requests against the application being tested. - Asserts that the expected status code and response body are returned by checking their values using Python's assert statement.
