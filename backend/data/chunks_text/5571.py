- Defines a function `get_link_clause()` that takes several arguments related to links between tables (`link_model`, `link_item_id`, etc.)
- If all required arguments are provided, it retrieves information about the specified link model from a dictionary of such models, extracts relevant columns from both involved tables, filters rows based on the given criteria for the link column, and returns an SQL expression representing the resulting filter condition for the primary key column.
- Returns `None` otherwise.
