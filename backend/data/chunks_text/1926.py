- Defines a function called `update_item` that takes two arguments: `item_id`, which is required and of type integer, and `item`, which is optional and has a default value provided by FastAPI's `Body()` decorator. The `openapi_examples` parameter allows for providing examples in JSON format. - The `Item` class represents the structure of the request body, containing properties such as `name`, `description`, `price`, and `tax`. - When the `item` argument is passed, its contents are validated against the expected schema using Pydantic's validation features. If invalid or missing values are detected, an HTTP status code of 400 Bad Request is returned. Otherwise, the updated item information is stored in a dictionary called `results` and returned to the client.
