- Defines a function called `post_form_param_set` that takes an optional argument `items`, which is initialized as an empty set using the built-in `Form()` class from Flask's WTForms library. - Returns the value of the `items` parameter, which can be used to store and retrieve form data submitted via HTTP POST requests in Flask applications. This allows for easy access and manipulation of user input without having to manually parse request parameters or query strings.
