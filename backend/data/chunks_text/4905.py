- Defines a fixture named `superuser_token_headers`, scoped to the module level, using the `pytest.fixture` decorator. - The function `get_superuser_token_headers()` is called inside the fixture definition and its result is returned as the value of the fixture. This likely retrieves an authentication token for a superuser account that can be used in subsequent tests to authenticate requests.
