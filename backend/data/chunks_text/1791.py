- Defines an asynchronous function `info` that takes a dependency of type `Annotated[config.Settings, Depends(get_settings)]`. This is used to retrieve the application's configuration from the database using the `get_settings()` function defined earlier. - The function returns a dictionary containing three key-value pairs representing important information about the app such as its name, admin email address, and maximum number of items per user. - By returning this data in JSON format, it can be easily consumed by other services or displayed on web pages for debugging purposes.
