- Defines a retry decorator using `aioretry` library that retries function execution up to a specified number of times (`max_tries`) with a fixed delay between attempts (`wait_seconds`) and logs informational messages before each attempt and warning messages after each failure. - Initializes a database connection using SQLAlchemy's `Session` class and executes a simple SELECT statement to ensure the database server is running properly. If an exception occurs during this operation, it is caught and rethrown with an error message logged at the ERROR level.
