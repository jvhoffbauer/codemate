- This endpoint takes an `Item` object and a list of `Item` objects as arguments using Pydantic's model validation. - The `sub_items` argument is decorated with `Depends`, which allows us to pass in a dependency function that returns a value based on some input or context. In this case, we are passing in our custom `sub_duplicate_dependency` function, which ensures there are no duplicate items in the list before returning it. - Finally, we simply return a list containing both the original `item` and the modified `sub_items`.
