- This function is an asynchronous view that checks if the incoming request has a `Content-Encoding: gzip` header, indicating that it's compressed using GZIP encoding. - If the request is compressed with GZIP, this function returns a dictionary containing the name of the request class (i.e., `Request`) to indicate that the request was decompressed successfully by FastAPI. - Otherwise, this function simply returns the name of the request class without any additional information.
