- Defines a fixture named `async_client` for use in pytests using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - Accepts two arguments: an instance of `FastAPI` and another variable called `prepare_database`. - Uses Python's `async with` statement to create an `AsyncClient` object from the `FastAPI` application at "http://testserver". - Yields the created `AsyncClient` object so it can be used by tests that require it.
