- Retrieves a global variable by its name or an optional alias from the current module's globals dictionary using the given key tuple of (variable_name, alias). If no alias is provided, it checks for the existence of the variable with the same name in another dictionary called __faa_globals__. This dictionary could be used to store variables that should have a different scope than the local one but still need to be accessed globally. - Raises a ValueError exception if the requested variable is not found in either dictionary and the default alias was not specified. The error message includes both names separated by commas as well as instructions on how to set the variable before accessing it again.
