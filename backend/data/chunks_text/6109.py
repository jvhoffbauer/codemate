- Defines a function named `receive_before_insert` that takes three arguments (`mapper`, `connection`, and `target`) when called by SQLAlchemy's event system.
- Asserts that the type of `target` is `models.User`. This ensures that this function will be executed only when inserting an instance of `models.User`.
- Increments a global variable named `event_counter.before` each time this function is invoked during the `before_insert` event.
