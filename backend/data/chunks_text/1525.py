- Defines a GET request for `"/items/"`, which returns JSON data based on query parameters passed in the URL.
- Includes an optional query parameter named `hidden_query`. If present, it is returned as part of the response body; otherwise, a default value is used instead.
- The `include_in_schema` argument is set to False, indicating that this query parameter should not be included in the OpenAPI schema generated by FastAPI's introspection feature. This can help keep the API documentation cleaner and more focused on the most important endpoints and features.
