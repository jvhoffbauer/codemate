- This method is a mock implementation of an HTTP GET request that returns data from a local CSV file based on the provided lowercase state abbreviation. - The `os` module is used to determine the path to the CSV file in relation to the current script's directory (`__file__`) using the `os.path.join()` function. - A string interpolation is performed to construct the filename by concatenating the determined filepath with the given state abbreviation appended with ".csv" extension.
