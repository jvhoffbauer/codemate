- Defines a Pydantic model called `JsonRpcResponse`, which is used to represent JSON RPC responses in this application. - The component name "_Response" is added as an attribute using the `@component_name()` decorator from FastAPI's OpenAPI generator plugin. This allows for better organization and documentation of components within the API specification. - The `jsonrpc` field is set to the string value "2.0". It also includes an example value in the JSON schema. - The `id` field can be either a string or integer, with a default value of None. Again, it has an associated example value in the JSON schema. - The `result` field represents the actual data returned by the server in response to a request. It is defined as a dictionary type. - The `model_config` attribute sets some configuration options for the model, including disallowing additional properties (`extra="forbid"`) and requiring all required fields when serializing/deserializing JSON (`json_schema_serialization_defaults_required=True`).
