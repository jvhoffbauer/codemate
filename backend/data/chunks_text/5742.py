- This method is called during Django's registration process to add custom views and URL patterns to the administration interface. - It iterates over all registered admin actions (which are instances of a subclass of Admin) and checks whether each one is an instance of RouterAdmin (a specific type of Admin). - If it finds a RouterAdmin, it calls its own `register_router()` method recursively. - After that, it returns from the parent class's `register_router()` method, which completes the registration process.
