- Decorates a function with @lru_cache to implement Least Recently Used (LRU) caching for its result, which is returned as an instance of `config.Settings`. - The `get_settings()` function retrieves and returns the settings object from the configuration module named 'config'. - This implementation allows for faster access to frequently used settings without having to recompute them each time they are requested.
