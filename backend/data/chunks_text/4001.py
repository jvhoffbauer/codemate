- This test uses `pytest`, `PyDantic`, and `FastAPI`.
- It creates a new item with the given YAML data using an HTTP POST request to the `/items/` endpoint of FastAPI.
- The expected status code is checked against the actual one returned by the server. If they match, the text of the response is not needed; otherwise, it's printed for debugging purposes.
- Finally, the JSON representation of the newly created resource is compared with the original YAML data, which should be equivalent after parsing and serialization.
