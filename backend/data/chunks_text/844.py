- Defines a function called `swagger_ui_redirect` that is asynchronous (uses `async`) and takes in a request object (`Request`) as an argument. - Returns the HTML response generated by calling another function, `get_swagger_ui_oauth2_redirect_html`, which likely generates the necessary HTML for redirecting to Swagger UI's OAuth2 authentication flow.
