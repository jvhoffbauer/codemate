- This function takes three dependencies: `src_path`, which is obtained from `self.path_dependency`, `reader_params`, which comes from `self.reader_dependency`, and `env`, provided by `self.environment_dependency`. - The function uses `rasterio.Env()` to create an environment object that contains settings like GDAL versions and data types. - It opens the input file using the `with` statement and passes it to the `self.reader()` method along with the dependency values. - Inside the context manager, it creates a Polygon representing the bounds of the dataset and returns a GeoJSON feature containing both the polygon and the metadata retrieved from the opened file.
