- This function tests the root file path endpoint by making a GET request to `"/files//home/johndoe/myfile.txt"` using Flask's built-in `client`.
- The response content is printed and an assertion checks that the status code is 200 (OK).
- Another assertion checks that the JSON response contains the expected file path ("/home/johndoe/myfile.txt").
