- Defines an asynchronous context manager called `ep_middleware` using the `@contextlib.asynccontextmanager` decorator. - Sets a global variable `ep_middleware_var` to a value inside the context manager. - Adds information about the request and response to a dictionary of calls being tracked by the middleware. - Yields control back to the caller within the context manager. - After leaving the context manager, adds more information about the call to the same dictionary of calls being tracked by the middleware.
