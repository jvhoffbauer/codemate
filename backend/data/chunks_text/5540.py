- This function `get_alias()` returns an alias for a given SQLAlchemy object or string representing a column name. - It checks whether the input is a `Column`, `InstrumentedAttribute`, `Label`, or just a plain string. - If it's a `Column`, it returns its name unless it belongs to another table, in which case it formats an alias using a template called `_alias_format`. - For `InstrumentedAttributes`, it follows similar logic but uses the class's tablename instead of the table itself. - The function also handles simple strings that are already known columns by returning them directly. - Finally, it falls back to an empty string as default behavior.
