- This endpoint allows users to initiate a password reset process by sending an email containing a unique link and token to their registered email address. - The `email` parameter is extracted from the URL path using FastAPI's router decorator syntax (`/password-recovery/{email}`). - If the user with the provided email doesn't exist in the database, a customized error message is returned instead of the default one. - A helper function called `generate_password_reset_token()` generates a new password reset token for the specified email address. - Another helper function named `send_reset_password_email()` sends an email to the user's registered email address containing both the generated token and the user's email address as arguments.
