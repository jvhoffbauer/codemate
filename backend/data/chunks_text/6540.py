- Defines a fixture `ep` that takes an entrypoint path as input and returns an instance of `Entrypoint`, which is a customized version of the JSON RPC server's default `Entrypoint`. - The `handle_exception` method overrides the default error handling behavior by converting some exceptions into different ones or leaving them unhandled based on their type. - Two methods are added to the `Entrypoint` instance returned by the fixture, each raising a specific kind of exception when called.
