- Defines a fixture named `client` using pytest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called by pytest when it encounters this fixture in tests that use it. - Inside the `get_function()`, we first import the Flask application object (`app`) from a specific module within our project's documentation sources (`docs_src.additional_status_codes.tutorial001_an_py39`). - We then create a new instance of Flask's built-in test client (`TestClient`) with this imported application and store it in a variable named `client`. - Finally, we return this `client` object so that other functions or classes can access it via dependency injection. This allows us to easily test our API endpoints without having to start up an entire server for each individual test case.
