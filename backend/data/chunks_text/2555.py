- Defines an asynchronous function called `call_next()`. - Takes no arguments and returns the result of calling the `app()` function with two positional arguments (`scope` and `receive`) and one keyword argument (`send`). - The returned value is then assigned to a variable named `await app(scope, receive, send)`, which allows for further processing or handling in subsequent lines of code.
