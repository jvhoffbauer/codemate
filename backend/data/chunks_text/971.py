- This function takes a sequence of errors as input and returns a normalized list of dictionaries representing those errors. - It uses recursion to handle nested lists of errors by calling itself with each sublist until all errors are flattened into a single list. - The function checks whether an error is already wrapped in a `ValidationError`, which is used to group multiple validation errors together. If so, it creates a new `ValidationError` object containing just that error and adds its resulting dictionary entries to the list of normalized errors. Otherwise, it simply appends the error to the list without wrapping it.
