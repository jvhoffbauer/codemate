- This function is part of FastAPI's router decorator and defines an endpoint for validating a Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) file using the `cog_info()` function from the `pyresample` library. - The `@factory.router.get()` decorator specifies that this function will be called when GET requests are made to the specified URL path ("/validate"). - The `response_model` parameter sets the expected format of the returned data to match the `Info` class defined elsewhere in the application. - Two arguments are passed into the function via dependency injection: `src_path`, which represents the location of the COG file being validated, and `strict`, which determines whether warnings should be treated as errors during validation. These values can be customized by passing them as query parameters in the request URL.
