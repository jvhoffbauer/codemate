- This is a class method of Pydantic's `BaseModel`, called `__get_pydantic_core_schema__`. It takes two arguments - `source` and `handler`.
- The purpose of this method is to provide a custom schema for a specific type using the `handler` function.
- By returning the result of calling `with_info_plain_validator_function()` on `cls._validate`, it adds information about validation errors to the error messages generated by Pydantic's validators.
