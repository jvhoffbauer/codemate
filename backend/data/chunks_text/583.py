- Imports `tutorial002_py310` module from `docs_src/tutorial` directory and assigns it to a variable named `mod`.
- Sets SQLAlchemy connection URL for testing purposes using `sqlite://` syntax.
- Creates an engine object using `create_engine()` function provided by SQLAlchemy library.
- Initializes a list called `calls` which will be used later to verify that expected print statements are executed during the test case execution.
- Retrieves the built-in `print()` function, saves its original behavior in a variable called `new_print`, and replaces it with a custom implementation (a mock object).
- Calls the main method of the imported module inside a context manager that patches the `print()` function with our custom implementation.
- Verifies that all expected print statements were indeed printed by checking if they appear in the `calls` list after executing the test case.
