- Defines a function `get_resp_model` that takes a class as an argument (`cls`) and returns its response model, which is stored in a dictionary attribute called `resp_model`.
- Checks whether the `resp_model` attribute already exists for the given class; if it does, simply returns it without further action.
- If the `resp_model` attribute doesn't exist yet, builds it using another method of the same class called `build_resp_model`, assigns it to the `resp_model` attribute, and then returns it.
