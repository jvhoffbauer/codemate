- Defines a function `get_path_param_le_int` that takes an optional parameter `item_id`, which is assigned a default value of a Pydantic model called `Path`. The `Path` class has a validator called `le` with a limit of 3, meaning the path parameter for this endpoint can be at most 3 characters long and must be an integer. - Returns the value of `item_id` after it's been passed through the `Path` validator to ensure it meets the specified constraints.
