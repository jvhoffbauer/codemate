- This method is called when an enumerated value (an instance of `enum.Enum`) is used as a key or index in a dictionary or sequence. - It checks whether the given object (either an enum or its value) matches any of the values of this enumeration class. - If the object is not an enum itself, it searches through all instances of this enumeration and returns true if their values match the object's value. - Otherwise, it delegates the lookup to the base implementation of `__contains__`.
