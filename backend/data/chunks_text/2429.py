- This endpoint is annotated with `@app.get` decorator and has a path parameter of "/sync_sync_raise". - It takes a dependency called `state`, which is generated by the `generator_state_try` function using the `Depends` utility. - The endpoint checks if the value of the `state` dependency matches a specific string, raising an error (`SyncDependencyError`) if it doesn't.
