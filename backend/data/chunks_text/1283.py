- Defines an async function called `create_upload_file` that takes a single argument named `file`, which is annotated with both `UploadFile` and `File`. The `File` annotation provides additional metadata about how to handle this parameter during parsing. - Inside the function body, we simply return a dictionary containing the filename of the uploaded file, which can be used for further processing or storage in our application's backend. Note that since this function returns a JSON response, it should ideally be wrapped inside a FastAPI route decorator (e.g., `@app.post("/upload")`) to make it accessible via HTTP requests.
