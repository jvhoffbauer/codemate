- This endpoint returns a JSON response with the current user's username, identified by their session token (implicitly passed through `Depends(get_current_username)`) and accessed via the `read_current_user()` function. - The `@app.get()` decorator specifies that this is an HTTP GET request handler for the "/users/me" URL path. - The `Depends()` parameter allows us to pass in a dependency resolver function (in this case, `get_current_username()`) which will be called before executing the main function body.
