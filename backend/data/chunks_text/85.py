- Defines a function `asc` that takes either a SQLAlchemy column expression or its label as an argument and returns a new SQLAlchemy expression representing an ascending sort order for the given column. - The `Union` type hint specifies that the input can be either a column expression (which is itself a subclass of `_ColumnExpressionOrStrLabelArgument`) or the value returned by such an expression, which is simply the underlying data type `_T`. - The `sqlalchemy.asc()` method is called with the provided column to create the actual sorting expression, but this call is wrapped in a type ignore statement because mypy complains about the dynamic nature of the `_ColumnExpressionOrStrLabelArgument` class hierarchy.
