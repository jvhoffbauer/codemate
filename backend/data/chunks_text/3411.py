- Tests if passing an integer greater than or equal to 3 as a path parameter for `/path/param-lt-int/{item_id}` results in a HTTP status code of 422 and returns an error message indicating that input should be less than 3 with a context limit of 3. - The error message conforms to JSON Schema's draft 7 specification (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-zypers-jsonschema-00) using PyDantic's built-in validation features, which can also generate URLs for each error type. - This implementation follows PEP8 style guidelines and includes comments explaining its functionality.
