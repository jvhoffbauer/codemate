- This function, named `read_user_me`, is asynchronous and returns a dictionary with one key-value pair containing the username of the currently logged in user. - The value for the 'username' key is set to 'fakecurrentuser'. - Since this function is marked asynchronous using the async keyword, it can be awaited by other functions that require its result without blocking the event loop.
