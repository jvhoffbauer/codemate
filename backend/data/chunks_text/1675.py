- Defines a function `query_or_cookie_extractor` that takes two arguments, `q` and `last_query`. The first argument is optional and defaults to the output of the `query_extractor` dependency resolver. The second argument is also optional but has a default value of `None`, which can be overridden by passing it as a cookie in subsequent requests using FastAPI's built-in cookie handling mechanism (`Cookie()`). - If `q` is empty or nonexistent, the function returns the value of `last_query`. This allows us to preserve the user's search query across multiple pages without having to pass it explicitly every time. - Otherwise, the function simply returns the value of `q`. In summary, this function provides a convenient way to either extract a query parameter from incoming requests or retrieve its previous value from cookies, depending on whether the current request contains such a parameter or not.
