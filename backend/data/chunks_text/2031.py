- This function, named `get_missing_translation_content`, is decorated with a decorator called `@lru_cache`. This means that it will cache its results in memory using least recently used (LRU) algorithm to improve performance for repeated calls. - The function takes a single argument `docs_dir` which represents the directory path containing all documentation files. - Inside the function, we first convert the given string argument into a `Path` object and then retrieve the parent directories of this path up to two levels above. We store these paths as variables `docs_dir_path` and `missing_translation_path`. - Finally, we read the content from the file at `missing_translation_path` location and return it after converting it to UTF-8 encoded text.
