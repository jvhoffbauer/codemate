- Tests authentication with an incorrect token type (in this case, a non-existing one) by making a GET request to /users/me and passing a header with the value 'Notexistent testtoken' as authorization. - Asserts that the server returns a HTTP status code of 401 Unauthorized, along with a JSON body containing the error message 'Not authenticated'. - Also checks if the WWW-Authenticate header is set correctly to Bearer, indicating that basic authentication was attempted but failed due to an invalid token type.
