- Defines a route `/fast_uuid` for returning a fast UUID using the `MyUuid` class from the `asyncpg` library
- Creates an instance of `MyUuid` and checks that it is a valid `uuid.UUID`, but not the same as the built-in `uuid.UUID` class
- Raises a `TypeError` when attempting to access variables on the `MyUuid` object (as this is not a regular Python object)
- Returns a dictionary containing the generated fast UUID
