- Defines a function `get_client()` that returns an instance of Flask's built-in test client, `TestClient`, for interacting with our application's endpoints without actually making network requests or starting a server. - Imports the necessary components from our project structure (docs_src and tutorial004_py310). - Uses the `with` statement to create a context manager around the `app` object, which is then passed as an argument to the `TestClient()` constructor. This ensures that any resources used by the `app` are properly cleaned up after we're done using them in this scope.
