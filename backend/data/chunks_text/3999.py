- Defines a fixture named `client` using pytest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called by pytest when it encounters this fixture in tests that use it. - Inside the function, we first import the Flask application object (`app`) from the specified tutorial file. - We then create a new instance of the `TestClient` class provided by Flask's testing module and pass our `app` as an argument. - Finally, we return the newly created `client` object for use in other test functions or classes.
