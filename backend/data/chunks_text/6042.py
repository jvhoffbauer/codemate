- Registers a custom admin interface for `Article` models using FastAPI's built-in `admin` module. - Defines the fields to be displayed in the list view of the admin interface. - Includes two instances of `LabelField`, which are used to display password and username fields without actually showing their values (for security reasons). - Overrides the default implementation of `get_select()` method to join the user table with the article table so that we can display the nickname instead of the actual username.
