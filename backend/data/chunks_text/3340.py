- This function tests a specific endpoint (specified by `path`) with custom request headers (stored in `headers`) and asserts that the HTTP status code returned is equal to the specified value (in `expected_status`). It also checks if the JSON response body matches the expected one (stored in `expected_response`). - The `TestClient` class from Flask's testing module is used to make requests against our app during unit tests. - By using this helper function instead of making direct requests through `requests`, we can easily reuse it for multiple endpoints without duplicating boilerplate code.
