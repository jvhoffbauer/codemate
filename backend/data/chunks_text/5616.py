- Defines a `route` function that handles HTTP requests with the specified path and method (GET in this case).
- Accepts two arguments: an instance of FastAPI's `Request` class representing the incoming request, and a JSON payload containing either a single object or a list of objects to be created.
- Checks whether the user has permission to create resources using the `has_create_permission` helper function. If not, returns an error response.
- Unpacks the input data into a list if it is a single object.
- Calls the `create_items` implementation to actually perform the creation operation. Catches any exceptions thrown during SQL execution and rolls back the transaction. Returns an error response in such cases.
- Returns a success response containing the number of newly created items (or just the first item if there was exactly one). The response format follows FastAPI's conventions for returning API responses.
