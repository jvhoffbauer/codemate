- Defines a function `LabelField` that takes three arguments: `label`, which is an instance of SQLAlchemy's `Label` class; `field`, which is an instance of Pydantic's `FieldInfo` class representing a database column or relationship; and `type_`, which is an optional argument specifying the data type of the field (defaulting to string).
- Uses the internal helper function `_get_label_modelfield` to retrieve the corresponding SQLAlchemy model field associated with the given label.
- Sets the alias property of the field object to match the key value of the label.
- If using Pydantic version 2, sets the annotation property of the field object to the specified data type.
- Assigns the retrieved model field to both the label and its underlying SQLAlchemy table, allowing Pydantic to validate against it during deserialization.
