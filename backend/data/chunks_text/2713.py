- Defines a GET endpoint with no annotations on the returned data type, using FastAPI's `@app.get()` decorator and specifying a custom name for the endpoint. - Returns a list of User objects (defined in another part of the application) as the response body, without any additional information or metadata provided by FastAPI's built-in serialization features. This is achieved by passing a plain Python list to the function and returning it directly, rather than relying on FastAPI's automatic JSON conversion logic.
