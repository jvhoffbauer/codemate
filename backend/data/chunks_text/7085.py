- This function is a helper method for obtaining an authorization header from user credentials using the `TestClient` class provided by Django Rest Framework (DRF). - It takes two arguments: a `TestClient` instance and a dictionary containing the username and password of the user to be authenticated. - The function makes a POST request to the API's login endpoint with the given credentials, parses the JSON response, extracts the access token, and returns it as part of an authorization header in the format "Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>".
