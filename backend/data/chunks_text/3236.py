- Defines a function `read_list()` that returns a list containing two dictionaries with an 'alias' key. - The returned list can be used to store and manage multiple values at once, making it more efficient than using separate variables for each value. - This function is useful in situations where you need to retrieve a list of related data from a database or file format, as it simplifies the process by returning everything in one go instead of requiring multiple calls.
