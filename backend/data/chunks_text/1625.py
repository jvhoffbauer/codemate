- This function is a FastAPI route with the `GET /items/` endpoint.
- It uses the `Annotated` decorator to create a dependency for the `CommonsQueryParams` class, which contains common query parameters like `q`, `skip`, and `limit`.
- The `Depends` parameter passes this dependency into the function as an argument named `commons`.
- Inside the function, we check if the `q` value from the `commons` object is not empty, and add it to our `response` dictionary.
- We then retrieve a slice of items from our fake database using the `skip` and `limit` values passed in by the user through the `commons` object.
- Finally, we update our `response` dictionary again to include these retrieved items, and return the entire `response` object.
