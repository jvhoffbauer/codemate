- Defines a function named `read_items` that takes an argument `id`, which is expected to be a list. - The function body (i.e., what happens inside the function) is currently empty and marked as not being tested with the `pragma: no cover` comment, indicating that this part of the code should not be executed during testing. This could mean that it's still under development or that its functionality has already been implemented elsewhere in the program.
