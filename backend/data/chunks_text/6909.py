- This method is a private helper function for converting a NumPy array of predictions to a HumanReadablePrice object. - It logs a debug message indicating that post-processing is taking place. - The first element in the prediction array contains the median house price (in raw model units), which is converted to a more readable format using the RESULT_UNIT_FACTOR constant. - A new HousePredictionResult object is created with just the median value and returned as the final output.
