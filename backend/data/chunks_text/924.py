- Defines a function called `on_event` that takes two arguments: `event_type`, which is a string representing the type of event (either'startup' or'shutdown'), and returns a callable function. - This decorated function adds an event handler to the router for the specified event type using the `add_event_handler()` method. - It also provides a warning message stating that this feature is deprecated and recommends using lifespan events instead, with a link to the relevant documentation.
