- Creates an SQLAlchemy engine with a SQLite database and sets it as the current engine for Flask-SQLAlchemy's application context (app_mod). - Retrieves all active sessions using Flask-SQLAlchemy's `get_session()` method and iterates over them. - Asserts that each retrieved session is of type `Session`, which is provided by Flask-SQLAlchemy, and checks if its bound object is equal to the previously created engine.
