- This function returns an object of type `State`.
- The name of the returned object is not specified, so it can be assumed to have a generic name like "result" or left unnamed altogether (Python allows this).
- The function's signature specifies that it takes no arguments and returns a single value of type `State`, which could represent some kind of application state in a larger program context.
