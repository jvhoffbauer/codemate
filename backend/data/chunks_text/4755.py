- Defines a function `get_recursive_submodel()` that returns a dictionary representing a recursively nested data structure with keys 'name','sub_items1' and'sub_items2'. - The returned dictionary has three levels of nesting, where each level contains a list or dictionary with key values corresponding to their respective names ('name','sub_items1','sub_items2'). - This implementation demonstrates how to create deeply nested structures using Python dictionaries and lists for storage purposes.
