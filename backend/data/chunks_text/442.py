- This function `test_tutorial` is testing a module called `tutorial009_py310` in the `docs_src.tutorial` package using pytest's `clear_sqlmodel` fixture to clear SQLModel's metadata before each test. - The module being tested, `tutorial009_py310`, defines variables `sqlite_url` and `engine`. These are set by this test case for use during execution of the module. - A list `calls` is initialized to store output printed during execution of the module. - The built-in Python print statement is replaced with a custom implementation that adds the output to the `calls` list instead of printing it directly. - The replacement print statement is obtained using Pytest's `get_testing_print_function` method. - Finally, the main function of the module under test (`mod.main()`) is executed within a context manager that replaces the built-in print statement with our custom one. After executing the module, we check if the expected output was stored correctly in the `calls` list.
