- This function tests sending a notification using Celery and Redis by making an HTTP request to the `/send-notification` endpoint of the Flask application defined in `docs_src.background_tasks.tutorial002_an_py39`. The email address 'foo@example.com' is passed along with a query parameter 'q'. - A temporary file named 'log.txt' is created before each run of this test case. If it already exists, it is deleted (skipped during testing). - After sending the notification, the content of the 'log.txt' file is checked for the message that was just sent.
