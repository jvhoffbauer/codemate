- This function updates an existing user in the database based on a request containing specific fields to be updated and the ID of the user to be updated. - It retrieves the user with the given ID from the database using `ORMUser.get`. - The provided request is used to create a new instance of the `User` model (which represents the same data as the `ORMUser` model but without the `_sa_instance_state` attribute). - The dictionary representation of this new `User` object is passed to the `update` method of the original `ORMMUser` object along with the `apply` method call to actually perform the update. - Finally, the updated `ORMMUser` object is returned after converting it back into a `User` object for consistency.
