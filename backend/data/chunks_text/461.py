- This is a unit test for the `tutorial010` module in the SQLModel tutorial section of the documentation. - It uses the `pytest-mock` plugin to mock out the built-in print function and capture its output. - The `create_engine` function from SQLAlchemy's engine factory is called to create an engine instance using the provided URL (a SQLite database). - A list named `calls` is initialized to store the captured outputs from the mocked print function. - The main function of the `tutorial010` module is executed inside a context manager that patches the built-in print function with a custom implementation that captures its arguments instead of printing them directly. - After executing the main function, the contents of the `calls` list are compared against expected values to verify correct behavior.
