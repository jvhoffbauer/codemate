- Defines a fixture named `client` using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called when the fixture is invoked in tests. - Inside the function, we first import the Flask application object (`app`) from the specified module path. - We then create a new instance of Flask Client (`TestClient`) for our application and store it in the `client` variable. - Finally, we return the `client` object so that it can be used by other test functions that invoke this fixture.
