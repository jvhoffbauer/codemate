- This method is called when an attribute of a class instance is accessed using dot notation (e.g., `my_object.some_attribute`)
- It checks whether the requested attribute name (stored in `__name`) exists as a key in the `update` dictionary of the current object. If it does, it returns the corresponding value from that dictionary instead of looking up the attribute on the underlying object (`self.obj`)
- Otherwise, it falls back to calling the built-in `getattr()` function with the same arguments to retrieve the attribute from `self.obj`.
