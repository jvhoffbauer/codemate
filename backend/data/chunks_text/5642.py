- Defines a read-only property named `route_read` for this class using Python's decorator syntax (@property).
- The return type of the function is any callable object (Callable[..., Any]). This means that the function can take any number and types of arguments, and return any value.
- If the property is accessed without being assigned to a variable or used in an expression, it raises a NotImplementedError exception, indicating that the implementation should be provided by subclasses.
