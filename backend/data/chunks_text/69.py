- This function takes a `Field` object as input (representing a column in a database table).
- It checks whether the data type of this field is compatible with a specific type (specified by `type`) and has a single value (i.e., not an array or list).
- If so, it returns that type; otherwise, it raises an error indicating that there's no matching SQLAlchemy type for this field.
