- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()` that takes two arguments: `item_id`, a required integer representing the ID of the item to retrieve, and `q`, an optional string query parameter for filtering items (aliased as "item-query"). - The function returns an object with keys 'item_id' and 'q', which will be passed directly to the API endpoint without further processing or validation. This allows for more flexibility in how the API is used by clients, while still providing some basic input validation through Pydantic's type hinting and error handling mechanisms.
