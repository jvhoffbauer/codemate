- Defines an asynchronous function `sum_numbers` that takes a list of integers (default value provided by `Body`) and returns a dictionary with a key "sum" containing the result of calling Python's built-in `sum` function on the input list. - The `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator is not used, indicating this function can be tested synchronously using pytest's regular test fixtures.
