- This function is a FastAPI dependency function that parses and returns the user data from an incoming JSON Web Token (JWT). - It takes `token`, which can be either a valid JWT or `None`. If it's `None`, it raises an exception indicating authentication is required. - The `Depends` decorator passes control to another dependency, `parse_jwt_user_data_optional`, when `token` is missing. - Otherwise, the function checks whether `token` exists; if so, it returns its contents as a `JWTData` object.
