- Defines a GET request handler for the `/b` endpoint using FastAPI's decorator syntax (@app.get)
- Includes an optional response definition (responses={}) with a status code of 204 and a description of "No Content". This is used to provide more detailed information about what the server should return in this specific case, rather than just the standard HTTP status codes.
- The function body is empty (pass), indicating that it doesn't perform any actions or return any data when called.
