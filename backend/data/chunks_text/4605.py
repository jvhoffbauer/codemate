- This function tests an incorrect token by making a GET request to "/users/me" with an invalid authorization header ("nonexistent"). - The expected status code is 401 (Unauthorized), and the text of the response should be displayed if the test fails. - If the test passes, we also check that the JSON returned contains the correct error message ("Could not validate credentials") and that the WWW-Authenticate header includes the required Bearer scheme and scope value ("scope='me'" ).
