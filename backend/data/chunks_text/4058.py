- Defines a function `test_openapi_schema` to test the OpenAPI schema of our FastAPI application.
- Makes an HTTP GET request to the `/openapi.json` endpoint using the `client` object provided by PyTest and checks if the status code is 200 (OK). If not, it prints the error message along with the response text.
- Asserts that the JSON response matches the expected structure defined in the `assert response.json() == {}` statement. Here we're comparing the actual JSON response returned from the server against the expected JSON format stored as a dictionary literal. The keys inside this dictionary represent the different components of the API such as paths, definitions, etc., while their values are nested dictionaries containing more details about each component. In this case, we're checking whether the version number, title, and path for reading items match what we expect them to be.
