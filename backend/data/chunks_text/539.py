- This function tests a specific example (tutorial001) in the SQLModel documentation by running its main function and verifying that it prints the correct output using `get_testing_print_function`. - The `clear_sqlmodel` parameter is used to clear any existing database connections before executing the test, ensuring isolation between different tests. - The `expected_calls` variable contains a list of strings representing the expected print statements produced by the tested module's execution. By checking if this list matches the actual call history recorded by `get_testing_print_function`, we can verify whether the module behaves correctly or not.
