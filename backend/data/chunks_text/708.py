- Defines an asynchronous function `websocket` that takes a `WebSocket` object as its argument.
- Verifies that the expected header 'x-request-id' is present in the request by using the `assert` statement to raise an AssertionError if it isn't found.
- Calls the `accept()` method of the `WebSocket` object to accept the connection, and then sends a JSON message containing the string "Hello WebSocket".
- Finally, closes the connection with the `close()` method of the `WebSocket` object.
