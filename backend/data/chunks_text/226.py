1. Defines a function `session_fixture()` that creates an SQLAlchemy engine and initializes its metadata, then yields a database session for use in tests.
2. The `connect_args={'check_same_thread': False}` option is used to disable thread local storage (TLS), which allows multiple threads to access the same connection without issues. This is necessary because we're using FastAPI's built-in test client, which runs tests concurrently across multiple threads.
3. We also set the `poolclass` parameter of our engine to `StaticPool`, which ensures that each request gets a new connection from the pool instead of reusing existing ones. This helps prevent race conditions when running tests concurrently.
4. Finally, we yield the session object so it can be accessed by other functions or classes within this context manager.
