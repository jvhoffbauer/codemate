- Defines a property `route_create` that returns a callable function for creating resources using Pydantic's `@property` decorator.
- The returned function takes two arguments - `Request` and `Annotated[Union[List[schema_create], schema_create], Body()]`. It checks whether the user has permission to create resources (using `has_create_permission`) and converts the input data into either a list or an individual object of type `schema_create`.
- If successful, it creates new resource items using `create_items`, rolls back the database transaction on failure, and handles errors by returning appropriate API responses.
- Finally, it returns the created resource(s) in the form of a `BaseApiOut` object with the `data` field containing the number of newly created items or their actual values depending on whether multiple or single creation was performed.
