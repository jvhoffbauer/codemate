- Defines a GET endpoint for retrieving a callable dependency with a query parameter `value`.
- Uses FastAPI's `Depends()` decorator to pass a callable function as a dependency, which is called before executing the endpoint handler.
- The returned value from the callable function is passed as an argument to the endpoint handler (in this case, assigned to the variable `value`).
