- This function tests the security of an API key by making a request to the `/users/me` endpoint with a predefined cookie containing the secret key. - The Flask-Testing library's `TestClient` is used to simulate HTTP requests and responses for testing purposes. - If the status code returned from the server is not 200 (OK), or if the JSON response doesn't match the expected format, the test fails.
