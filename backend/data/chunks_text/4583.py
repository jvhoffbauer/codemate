- Tests if a token without the required `scope` can be used to retrieve user information using FastAPI and OAuth2 authentication. - Uses the `get_access_token` function from the `test_client` object provided by PyTest to obtain an access token for testing purposes. - Makes a GET request to the `/users/me` endpoint with the obtained access token as authorization header. - Asserts that the status code is 401 (Unauthorized), and the error message returned in the body of the response contains the expected detail ("Not enough permissions"). - Asserts that the WWW-Authenticate header contains the expected value ('Bearer scope="me"') indicating that the requested resource requires the specified scope.
