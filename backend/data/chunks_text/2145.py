- Defines a function `get_path_param_lt_gt` that takes an optional argument `item_id`, which is bound to a Pydantic model with path parameters for less than (`lt`) and greater than (`gt`) values of 3 and 1 respectively. - Returns the value of `item_id`. This can be used in URLs as part of the path segment, where the parameter values are passed dynamically based on the requested resource ID. For example, `/items/{item_id:float lt 3 gt 1}` would match paths like `/items/2.5` or `/items/4.0`.
