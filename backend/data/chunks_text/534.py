- Imports `tutorial001_py310` module from `docs_src/tutorial/connect` directory and assigns it to a variable named `mod`.
- Sets SQLAlchemy's connection URL for SQLite database using `mod.sqlite_url` attribute.
- Creates an engine object using `create_engine()` function provided by SQLAlchey library, passing in the previously set connection URL.
- Initializes a list called `calls` which will be used later to store print statements made during execution of the `main()` method.
- Retrieves a mock implementation of Python's built-in `print()` function using `get_testing_print_function()`, and stores it in a variable named `new_print`. This is done so that we can capture all print statements made inside our unit tests.
- Patches (replaces) the original `print()` function with the newly created mock implementation using `patch()` decorator.
- Executes the `main()` method defined within the imported `tutorial001_py310` module.
- Asserts that the captured print statements match the expected output stored in a separate variable called `expected_calls`.
