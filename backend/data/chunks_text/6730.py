- Initializes Sentry SDK and binds a custom transport function using MonkeyPatching
- Checks whether the current test is being executed in an isolated environment (using `unittest.mock`)
- If it's not, creates a new Hub instance without any context data and passes it as an argument to the custom initialization function
- Otherwise, uses the existing Hub instance from the parent process and passes it directly to the initialization function
