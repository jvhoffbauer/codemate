- This function is called by `FastAPI` to resolve shared dependencies between multiple endpoints in a single HTTP request. - It takes four arguments: an incoming HTTP request (`http_request`), a `BackgroundTasks` object for asynchronous tasks, the response of a dependent endpoint (`sub_response`), and a dictionary (`dependency_cache`) that stores previously resolved dependencies. - The function initializes an empty cache (`dependency_cache`) since `FastAPI` may recreate it if left empty. - If there are any shared dependencies defined for this endpoint, they're passed along with some other parameters to another function named `solve_dependencies`. - Any errors encountered during dependency resolution are raised as a `RequestValidationError`, which is handled by `FastAPI`'s error handling mechanism.
