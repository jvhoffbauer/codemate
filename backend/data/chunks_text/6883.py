- Defines a fixture named `test_client` using PyTest's decorator syntax (@pytest.fixture())
- Initializes an instance of Flask application (get_app()), and passes it to the TestClient constructor for creating a client object that can be used in tests
- Yields the created client object, which is available inside test functions decorated with @pytest.mark.usefixtures("test_client") or @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)

2. How would you modify the previous example to automatically pass the `test_client` fixture into all test functions without explicitly specifying it each time? Answer according to: You may also use autouse fixtures to automatically run your fixtures before every single test function in the module where they are defined. This is done by setting the autouse attribute to True on the fixture definition.

In this case, thereâ€™s no need to specify the fixture name when calling pytest.mark.usefixtures(). Instead, just call pytest.fixture(), passing the name of the fixture as argument. The fixture will then be automatically passed to the test function as positional argument.

This feature allows you to avoid repetitive setup code at the beginning of each test method. It makes your tests more readable and easier to maintain.

The following example shows how to define an autouse fixture called db:

```python
import os
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = Column(String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String(254), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password = Column(String(254), nullable=False)

db_url = "sqlite:///" + os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "data.db")
engine = create_engine(db_url)
session_factory = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
Session = session_factory('session')

@pytest.fixture(scope="module", autouse=True)
def init_db():
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
    Session.query(User).delete()
    return Session

#... Your tests here...
```

In this example, we first initialize our SQLAlchemy engine and session factory. We then define an initialization fixture called init_db, which creates the database tables if necessary, deletes existing data from the users table, and returns the session factory.

We set the scope parameter to "module" so that the fixture is executed once per module instead of once per test function. By default, scopes are "function".

Finally, we mark the fixture as autouse by setting its autouse attribute to True. Now, the fixture will be automatically invoked before running any test function within the same module. No longer do we have to manually invoke the fixture in each test function!
