- Defines an endpoint `/items/` with GET request using FastAPI's decorator syntax
- Uses Pydantic's `Union` type hinting and query parameters to accept optional query parameter `q`, which is used to filter item data from the database based on user input
- Returns JSON response containing either all available items or filtered items based on the value of `q`. If `q` is not provided, it returns a dictionary with keys 'items' and 'q'. The latter key contains the original value of `q` passed as argument. This allows clients to see what was searched previously without having to retype the same query again.
