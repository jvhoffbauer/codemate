- Registers a websocket endpoint at `"/depends-err/"`, using the `@router.websocket()` decorator from FastAPI's built-in `WebsocketRouter`. - Dependency injection is used to provide an instance of the `ws_dependency_err` function as an argument to the route handler (`data` parameter). This dependency is defined elsewhere in the application and raises an exception when called. - The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how FastAPI handles errors during dependency resolution for web socket endpoints. In this case, since the provided dependency raises an error, the route will not be registered and the `pass` statement inside the route handler will never execute.
