- Defines a fixture named `date_time_attribute`, scoped to the session level, that returns an instance of the `Attribute` model with specific properties and values predefined. - Uses the `AsyncDal` class from the `adal` package to interact with the database. - Creates two instances of the `AttributeValue` model associated with the defined `Attribute`. The names, slugs, and values are generated based on the release dates passed as arguments.
