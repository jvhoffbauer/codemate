- Initializes a SoftDeleteModelAdmin instance with an AdminApp object passed as argument to the constructor. - Calls the parent class's constructor using Python's built-in `super()` function. - Performs an assertion check on whether the model being administered by this admin has a field named 'delete_time'. If not, raises an AssertionError exception with an error message indicating that SoftDeleteModelAdmin requires such a field in the model it is managing.
