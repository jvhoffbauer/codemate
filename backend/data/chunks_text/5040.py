- This function is called when a new WebSocket connection is established between the client and server. - The `sid`, `environ`, and `auth` arguments contain information about the connection, such as its unique identifier (`sid`) and any authentication data provided by the client (`auth`). - The function can perform initialization tasks for this specific connection, such as adding it to a list of active connections or assigning resources based on the user's identity (if authenticated).
