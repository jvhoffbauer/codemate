- Defines a function called `select` with three positional arguments (`entity_0`, `entity_1`, and `entity_2`) of types `_TScalar_0`, `_TScalar_1`, and `_TScalar_2`, respectively. The `type: ignore` annotation is used to suppress mypy's warning about unused type hints in this case. - Returns a new object of type `Select` that takes a tuple as its argument containing all three input entities. This suggests that the `select` function may be involved in selecting or filtering data based on multiple criteria from these entities. However, without seeing the implementation details inside the ellipsis (`...`), it's difficult to provide more specific information.
