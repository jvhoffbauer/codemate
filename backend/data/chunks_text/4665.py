- Tests uploading a file without an authentication token (i.e., missing `Authorization` header). - Uses `TestClient` to simulate HTTP requests and verify responses. - Writes a sample file to disk using Python's built-in `tempfile` module. - Passes the file object to the `client.post()` method along with other request parameters. - Verifies that the server returns a 422 Unprocessable Entity status code indicating invalid input. - Parses the JSON error message returned by the server and checks its structure and contents.
