- Defines two routes with similar signatures that both call the `map_viewer()` function. The first route matches requests to `/map`, while the second one matches requests to URLs containing a specific `TileMatrixSetId`. - Accepts several query parameters and dependencies, including `src_path`, `TileMatrixSetId`, `tile_format`, `tile_scale`, `minzoom`, `maxzoom`, `layer_params`, `dataset_params`, `pixel_selection`, `buffer`, `rescale`, `color_formula`, `colormap`, `render_params`, `backend_params`, and `reader_params`. These arguments are used to customize various aspects of the generated tiles, such as their format, resolution, style, and content. - Returns an HTML response using FastAPI's built-in template rendering feature, passing some variables to the template. This allows displaying interactive maps based on the requested data sources and configurations.
