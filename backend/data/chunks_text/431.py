- This test case is part of a tutorial in SQLAlchemy's documentation and tests the `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `DELETE` statements using the `Session` class. - It creates an instance of the module being tested (`mod`) and sets its URL to connect to a local SQLite database. - The test raises an exception when multiple results are found during a query, indicating that the program should handle this error gracefully. - The test then demonstrates how to use the `Session` class to execute a DELETE statement against the table defined by the `Hero` model. - Finally, it shows how to intercept the built-in print function and capture its output during execution of another method (`select_heroes`) in the same module.
