- This function is a middleware that wraps around JSON RPC requests and responses to log certain information during request processing. - It keeps track of the ID of each request in a dictionary called `_calls`. - For each request, it logs an entry with the method name ('mw_first'), event type ('enter' or 'exit'), original request data, response data, and any exceptions raised during execution using Python's built-in `sys.exc_info()` function.
