- Defines a class method `__get_validators__` for the `UploadFile` type annotation, which returns an iterable of validator functions to be used during deserialization. - The single yielded function is `cls.validate`, which is assumed to be a validation function that takes in a value and raises a ValueError if it's not valid. - This implementation allows Pydantic to automatically validate user input when converting JSON or other data formats into Python objects using this custom type hint.
