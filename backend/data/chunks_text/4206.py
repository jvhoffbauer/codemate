- This function, `test_get()`, tests the GET request to the root URL (/) using Flask's built-in testing client. - The expected content of the response is set to a fixed byte sequence called `fake_content`. - The actual content returned by the server is compared with this expected value multiplied by 10, indicating that we expect the same data repeated ten times in the response body.
