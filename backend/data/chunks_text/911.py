- This method is overriding `matches()` from a parent class (not explicitly shown). - It takes in a `Scope`, which represents a dictionary of variables and values that can be accessed by templates during rendering. - The method returns a tuple containing both a `Match` object representing whether or not this route matched the current request URL, as well as an updated `Scope` with a new key called "route" set to the current instance of the Route object.
