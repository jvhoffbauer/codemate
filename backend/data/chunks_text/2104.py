- Defines a GET request for an event with the specified title using FastAPI's router decorator and passes the `Event` object as an argument to the callback function. - The callback function takes an instance of the `Event` class, which represents a specific calendar event in Google Calendar, as its parameter. - This implementation is used to handle custom event URLs generated by Google Calendar when sending invitations or sharing events. It allows developers to perform additional actions based on the event details without having to rely solely on the default notification email sent by Google Calendar.
