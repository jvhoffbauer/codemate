- Tests the `/async` endpoint using Flask's built-in testing client to simulate a request and verify its behavior. - Asserts that the initial value of the global variable `state['/async']` is 'asyncgen not started'. - Makes an HTTP GET request to the `/async` route and stores the response in the `response` object. - Verifies that the status code of the response is 200 (OK) and saves the text content for debugging purposes. - Parses the JSON data from the response body and compares it with the expected result ('asyncgen started'). - Updates the global variable `state['/async']` after the async function completes execution.
