- This function tests a specific example (tutorial003) in the SQLModel documentation by running it and checking that certain print statements are called. - The `clear_sqlmodel` parameter is used to clear any existing database connections before running the test, ensuring isolation between tests. - The `get_testing_print_function` method is used to capture all printed output during the execution of the test, which can then be checked against expected values using the `assert` statement at the end.
