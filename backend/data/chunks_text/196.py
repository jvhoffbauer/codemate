- This function is called `read_heroes`. It takes in several arguments with default values using the `*` syntax and the `Depends` decorator to retrieve a database connection from another function (`get_session`) that we assume exists elsewhere. - The `offset` argument specifies how many records to skip before starting to fetch results, while the `limit` argument limits the number of records returned by the query. These parameters are annotated with type hints for better type checking. - The function returns all rows selected by executing a SQL SELECT statement on the `Hero` table, filtered by the provided `offset` and `limit`, and converts them into a list of Python objects representing the Hero entities.
