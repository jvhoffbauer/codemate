- This function takes a callable object `call` as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether it's coroutine-callable or not. - It first checks if `call` is a function using `inspect.isroutine()`. If yes, then it further checks if it's a coroutine function using `inspect.iscoroutinefunction()`. - If `call` is a class, it immediately returns false since classes cannot be directly called like functions/coroutines can. - Finally, it checks for the presence of a special method named `__call__`, which is required to make a class callable. If this method exists and is itself a coroutine function (checked by calling `inspect.iscoroutinefunction()` on it), then we know that the original callable object is also coroutine-callable via its `__call__` method.
