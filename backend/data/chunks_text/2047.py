If so, sets the path to the custom configuration file for that version of MkDocs (`../en/mkdocs.insiders.yml`) in the OS environment variable `INSIDERS_FILE`. - Sets a library search path for macOS systems running Homebrew and the Cairo graphics library by adding it to the OS environment variable `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH`.
