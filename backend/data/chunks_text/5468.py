- This function reads a JSON file located in the `test` directory and returns its contents as a Python dictionary using the built-in `json` module's `load()` method. - The path to the JSON file is constructed by joining the `DATA_DIR` (presumably an environment variable or configuration setting) with the filename passed as argument to the function. - Note that this function assumes the JSON data can be represented as a plain Python dictionary; if more complex structures are expected, additional type hinting may be necessary.
