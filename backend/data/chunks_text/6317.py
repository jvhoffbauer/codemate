- This function generates a new access token based on provided credentials (username and password) using FastAPI's built-in `security` module. - It retrieves the user from the database by querying the `User` model with the given email address. - If the user doesn't exist or the password is incorrect, it raises a customized error message with status code 400 ("Bad Request"). - Otherwise, it returns the generated access token as a JSON object containing the user ID in string format.
