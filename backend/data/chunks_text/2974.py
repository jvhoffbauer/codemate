- Defines an asynchronous function `get_asynchronous_method_dependency()` that takes a positional argument `value` with a default value provided by the dependency `Depends(methods_dependency.asynchronous)`. - The dependency `Depends(methods_dependency.asynchronous)` is used to inject the result of calling the asynchronous method `asynchronous()` from the `MethodsDependency` class into this function's parameter `value`. - This function can be used in other asynchronous functions or routes where it may be useful to have access to the result of the `asynchronous()` method without having to call it directly.
