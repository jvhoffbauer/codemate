- Defines a function called `info` that takes three arguments: `src_path`, `reader_params`, and `env`. These arguments are obtained using dependency injection from other functions (`path_dependency`, `reader_dependency`, and `environment_dependency`) defined elsewhere in the program. - Uses the `rasterio.Env` context manager to set up an environment for reading the data. This allows us to pass additional parameters to the library without having to repeat them every time we open a file. - Opens the input file using the `self.reader` method, passing it both the path and any necessary parameters provided by the user through `reader_params`. The resulting object is assigned to the variable `src_dst`. - Returns the metadata of the opened file using its `info()` method.
