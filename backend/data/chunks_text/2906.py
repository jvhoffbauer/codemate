- Defines a function `get_header` with a default parameter `someheader` of type `Header`. - The `*` before the argument name indicates that it is a keyword-only argument, meaning it must be passed as a named argument in function calls. - The `=` sign after the argument name assigns a default value to the parameter, which can be overridden when calling the function by passing an explicit value for this argument. In this case, we're using the built-in Python class `collections.abc.MutableMapping` subclass called `Header`, but you could replace it with any other object or function that returns what you need for your specific use case.
