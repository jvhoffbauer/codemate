- Defines a function called `select` with four arguments and one positional-only argument (marked by triple underscores). The first three arguments are of type `_TScalar_*`, which is not explicitly defined in this snippet but likely represents some scalar data types. - Returns an object of type `Select` that combines tuples containing values from all input arguments. This suggests that the `select` function performs some kind of selection or filtering operation on multiple inputs to produce a single output tuple. However, without seeing the implementation details it's difficult to provide more specific information about its behavior.
