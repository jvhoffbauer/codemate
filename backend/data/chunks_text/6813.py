- This function retrieves a list of User objects from the database using SQLAlchemy's `select`, with pagination provided by the `skip` and `limit` parameters.
- The `dependencies` parameter is used to ensure that the requesting user has superuser privileges before allowing access to this endpoint.
- The returned list of Users is converted to a list of `UserOut` objects (presumably containing only necessary fields for display purposes), which are then serialized and sent back as JSON in response to the HTTP GET request.
