- This function returns an `AmisAPI` object that makes a POST request to the list endpoint of the router with query parameters for pagination and sorting. - If filter permissions are denied, it simply returns the API without any filters or search terms added. - It adds dynamic search fields based on the parser's aliases using the `get_alias()` method. - For each filter found from the request, it adds its name as a dynamic parameter to the API's data dictionary. - For date/time model fields, it adds a range operator (-) instead of a prefix operator ([]) to allow more advanced queries.
