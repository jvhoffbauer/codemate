- Tests the `_get_model_config` function, which is a private helper method for retrieving configuration options from a Pydantic model instance (in this case, `Foo`) using the `ConfigDict` subclass of `Config`. - Verifies that the returned dictionary contains the expected value ('True') for the 'from_attributes' option, as specified when creating the `ConfigDict` object during the definition of the `Foo` model.
