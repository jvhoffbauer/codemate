- Uses `pytest`, `pydantic`, and `fastapi` libraries for testing a FastAPI endpoint that returns JSON data with width, length, and calculated area values. - Sends an HTTP GET request to the root URL of the API using PyTest's built-in `TestClient`. - Asserts that the status code is 200 (OK) and saves the response text in case of failure. - Parses the JSON response body and asserts that it contains expected keys and values.
