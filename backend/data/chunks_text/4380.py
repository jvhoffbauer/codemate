- Sends GET requests to `/items/` and `/users/` endpoints using Flask's built-in testing client (client)
- Asserts that both responses have a status code of 200 (OK), and displays the text content if the assertion fails


Based on the provided context, it seems like this function is part of unit tests for an application developed with Flask framework. The function checks whether the server returns the correct HTTP status codes when making requests to two different endpoints - `/items/` and `/users/`. If either request fails or has an unexpected status code, the function will display the response body as well. This helps in debugging any issues related to API endpoints during development.
