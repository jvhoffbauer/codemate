- This function takes a `str` representing a database table name as input and returns an optional `ModelAdmin` object associated with that table.
- It iterates over all registered administrators (i.e., classes derived from `ModelAdmin` or `AdminApp`) to find one whose bound model matches the given table name.
- If no exact match is found, it recursively searches through any nested `AdminApp` objects until a matching `ModelAdmin` is located.
- Returns `None` if no suitable `ModelAdmin` was found.
