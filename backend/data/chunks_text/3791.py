- Defines a function `test_app` that tests the Flask application by making an HTTP GET request to the URL "/v2" using the `client` object provided by Flask's testing module. - Asserts that the status code of the response is equal to 200 and saves it in a variable called `response_status`. If the condition fails, the test will fail immediately without executing further statements. - Asserts that the JSON response body contains a key'message' with value 'Hello World'. This ensures that the expected data is returned from the server.
