- Tests a Flask route that returns a dictionary with exact keys and values using the `ResponseModel`, `AnnotationModel`, and `ReturnExactDict` decorators from flask-restx. - Uses the `client` object to simulate an HTTP GET request to the specified URL. - Asserts that the status code of the response is 200 (OK) and saves its text for debugging purposes if necessary. - Asserts that the JSON body of the response matches the expected dictionary with the given key-value pairs.
