- Defines an asynchronous function `create_file` that takes a file object (default is created using built-in `File`) as input parameter and returns a dictionary with key 'file_size' containing the length of the provided file. - The function uses async/await syntax to indicate it can be awaited by other coroutines, but since there are no actual asynchronous operations inside this function, it could also have been defined synchronously without any performance impact.
