- `__post_init__` is a special method called after object initialization to perform additional setup tasks. - This function registers routes and extensions, as well as updates endpoint dependencies using the `add_route_dependencies` method provided by Flask-RESTful. - The `register_routes` and `register` methods are likely defined elsewhere in the class hierarchy or imported from other modules. They are responsible for adding endpoints (HTTP requests/responses) and extensions (plugins that add functionality), respectively.
