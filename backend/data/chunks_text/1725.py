- This function is a GET request for an item with a specific ID (stored in `item_id`) using FastAPI's decorator syntax (@app.get).
- It accepts two query parameters: `q`, which filters items by name or keyword, and `size`, which limits the number of returned items based on their size. These are validated using Pydantic's Annotations feature.
- The function returns a dictionary containing the requested item ID and any optional filtering information provided through the query parameters.
