- Defines an `async` function called `connection` that uses a context manager to create and manage a database transaction using SQLAlchemy's `engine`. - Yields the connection object, allowing it to be used in other parts of the program (e.g., inside another `async` function). - Automatically rolls back any changes made during the transaction when the function exits or encounters an exception.
