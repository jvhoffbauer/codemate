- This function is connected to the `@task_postrun` decorator, which means it will be executed after a Celery task completes running. - The purpose of this function is to clear two global variables (`celery_current_id` and `celery_parent_id`) that store information about the current and parent tasks, respectively. - By clearing these variables, we ensure that they are not accidentally reused by subsequent tasks, as their values may still contain data from previous executions.
