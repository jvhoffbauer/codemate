- This function takes in two arguments `annotation` and `globalns`. It returns a modified version of the input `annotation`, which is called `any` initially. - If the type of `annotation` is a string, it creates a new object `ForwardRef` with that string as its argument. The `evaluate_forwardref()` function is then called to replace any forward references (i.e., unresolved names) within this string with their actual values from the `globalns` dictionary. - After these modifications are made, the final result is returned. In summary, this function converts string annotations into resolved objects by evaluating them using the provided `globalns` dictionary.
