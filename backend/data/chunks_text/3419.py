- Tests that passing a non-integer value (in this case, a decimal) for a path parameter with type int raises a validation error with status code 422 and appropriate error message in JSON format using Pytest Flask's `client` object. - The error message includes details such as the location of the invalid input ("path" and "item_id"), the specific error type ("int_parsing"), and a helpful explanation of why the input failed validation ("unable to parse string as an integer"). - This test helps ensure that our API enforces data integrity by preventing unexpected or malicious inputs from causing unpredictable behavior or security vulnerabilities.
