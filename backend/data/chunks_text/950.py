- This function takes a sequence of any types as input and returns a list of dictionaries representing normalized error messages. - The `type: ignore[return-value]` annotation is used to suppress a mypy warning about returning a generic type (List) instead of a specific subclass (List[Dict]). - In practice, this function may perform some normalization logic on each error object in the sequence before adding it to the dictionary and appending it to the result list. However, since we're not provided with that implementation detail, these bullet points are based solely on the signature and docstring of the function.
