- Tests that making a GET request to `/users` without providing an authentication token results in a HTTP status code of 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and an error message indicating that the 'token' query parameter is required. - Uses Pytest-mock to create a mock instance of FastAPI's `TestClient`, which allows for testing API endpoints without actually running the server. - Utilizes Pydantic's validation features to ensure that the 'token' query parameter is present before allowing access to protected resources.
