- This function is an asynchronous method that retrieves a user's information using the `read()` operation of FastAPI's dependency injection system (Pydantic). - The `@anndecorator` decorator from Pydantic is used to define the input parameter type and its dependencies. In this case, it expects a `User` object obtained through the `get_current_active_user()` function provided by FastAPI's security middleware. - The returned value is the authenticated user instance passed in as an argument, which can be further processed or manipulated within other functions or endpoints.
