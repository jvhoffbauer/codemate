- This function tests the `get_valid_headers()` method by making a GET request to the `/items/` endpoint with valid authentication headers (`X-Token` and `X-Key`) using Flask's built-in testing client. - The expected status code is checked against the actual status code returned by the server. If they don't match, an error message containing both codes and the response body is printed for debugging purposes. - Finally, the JSON response from the server is compared against a predefined list of items to ensure that it matches what we expect.
