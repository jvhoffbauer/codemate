- Imports `tutorial002_py310` module from the `docs_src.tutorial` package and assigns it to a variable named `mod`.
- Sets the value of `mod.sqlite_url` to a SQLAlchemy URL for an in-memory SQLite database.
- Creates a SQLAlchemy engine using `create_engine()` and sets its value to `mod.engine`.
- Initializes a list called `calls` that will be used later to verify function calls made during testing.
- Retrieves the built-in `print()` function, saves it in a variable called `new_print`, and replaces the original `print()` function with a mock object (created by `get_testing_print_function()`) that adds each printed string to the `calls` list instead of actually printing it.
- Calls the `main()` method of the `mod` module inside a context manager provided by `patch()`, which patches the built-in `print()` function with our custom mock object. This allows us to capture all print statements made within the `main()` method without actually displaying them on the console.
- After executing the `main()` method, checks whether the expected functions were called using the `check_calls()` function provided by Pytest's `mock` plugin. If any unexpected function call is detected, this test case fails.
