- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()` that takes a query parameter (optional) with default value and minimum length of 3 characters. - Uses Pydantic's `Query` class to parse the query string into a Python object. - Returns a dictionary containing either just the list of items or also includes a 'q' key with the parsed query string, depending on whether the query was provided.
