- This function is a decorator for FastAPI routers that adds dependency injection and handling of WebSockets using Starlette's `websockets` module. - It takes two arguments: a `WebSocket` object representing the incoming WebSocket connection, and an optional argument `data`, which is passed to the decorated endpoint as a parameter (in this case, it comes from another dependency called `ws_dependency`). - The function first accepts the WebSocket connection, then sends back the value of `data` using the `send_text` method, and finally closes the WebSocket connection.
