- Defines a custom serialization function for the `a_uuid` field using the `@field_serializer()` decorator provided by Django Rest Framework (DRF). - The `serialize_a_uuid()` function takes in a value `v`, which is the object being serialized, and returns its string representation as output. This ensures that UUIDs are correctly formatted when displayed to users or sent over the network.
