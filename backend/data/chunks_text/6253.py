- Defines a context manager function `mock_client_session` to replace the global variable `httputils.CLIENT_SESSION` with an `AsyncMock` instance during test execution. - Sets up a mock for the `get` method of the `httputils.CLIENT_SESSION`. - Yields the modified `httputils.CLIENT_SESSION` object, allowing it to be used in tests within the context manager block. - Cleans up by deleting the modified `httputils.CLIENT_SESSION` after the tests have completed.
