- Defines a function `generate_operation_id` that takes two arguments `route` (an instance of FastAPI's `routing.APIRoute`) and `method` (a string representing the HTTP request method).
- The function generates an operation ID for the given API route and HTTP method using the `generate_operation_id_for_path` helper function. If the route already has an operation ID set, it returns that instead.
- This function is marked as deprecated with a warning message, indicating that it may be removed in future versions of FastAPI.
