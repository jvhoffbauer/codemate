- Defines an asynchronous function `create_file()` that takes a single optional argument `file`, which can be either bytes or `None`. If no file is provided (i.e., `None`), returns a dictionary with a message indicating so. - If a file is provided, its size in bytes is returned as part of another dictionary. The `File` class from Pydantic's standard library is used to handle default values for this parameter.
