- This is a unit test for the `docs_src.tutorial.relationship_attributes.create_and_update_relationships` module using pytest's `clear_sqlmodel` fixture to clear SQLModel's metadata before each test. - The `import` statement imports the specific tutorial class we want to test and assigns it to the variable `mod`. - We set the URL of our database connection string to an in-memory SQLite database and pass this URL to the `create_engine()` function to obtain a connection object that can be used by SQLAlchemy. - We define a list called `calls` which will store any print statements made during execution of the module under test. - Using Python's built-in `patch()` decorator, we replace the standard `print()` function with one that captures its arguments and stores them in the `calls` list instead. - Finally, we call the main method of the module being tested while passing the modified `print()` function to the `with` block. After exiting the context manager, we check if the `calls` list contains the expected output based on what was printed during testing.
