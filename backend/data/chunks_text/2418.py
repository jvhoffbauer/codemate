- This endpoint is decorated with `@app.get` and takes a dependency on `context_b`. - The function asserts that the values of `context_b` and `context_a` are correct, indicating that it's checking dependencies. - If any dependency fails (in this case, raising an error), FastAPI raises a `HTTPException` with status code 500 and the message from the exception.
