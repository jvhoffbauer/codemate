- Defines a function called `select` with three arguments (`__ent0`, `__ent1`, and `entity_2`) that are annotated as types using Pydantic's `_TC` and `_TScalar` aliases. The first two arguments represent collections of objects to be selected from, while the third argument is a scalar value used for filtering or sorting. - Returns a new object of type `Select` which represents a selection operation on the input collections based on the provided criteria. This object can then be further processed by other functions in the library.
