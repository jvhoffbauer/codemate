- This function, `test_return_defaults`, tests whether a GET request to the root URL returns an empty dictionary for the'sub' key in the JSON response body. - The Flask application is not explicitly called here; instead, we use the built-in Flask testing client (client) provided by Flask itself. - We make a GET request using this client and store its response object in the variable'response'. - Finally, we check if the JSON representation of the response matches our expected output ({'sub': {}}) using Python's built-in unittest library's assert statement.
