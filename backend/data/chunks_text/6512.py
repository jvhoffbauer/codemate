- This fixture is a context manager that automatically runs after all tests have finished executing, thanks to `autouse=True`.
- It captures error logs from both setup and test functions using `caplog`, which provides access to PyTest's internal logger.
- If any errors are found (i.e., log level WARNING or higher), it fails the entire test run with an informative message containing the list of error messages.
