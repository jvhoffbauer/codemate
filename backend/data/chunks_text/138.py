- Defines a function called `select` with four arguments (`__ent0`, `__ent1`, `__ent2`, and `entity_3`) that are annotated as types using PEP 484 type hints. The first three arguments have the same type hint of `_TCCA`. - Returns a generic type called `Select` which takes a tuple containing the original argument types (`(_T0, _T1, _T2)`) along with the new scalar type (`_TScalar_3`) passed in as an argument to the function. - The implementation details inside the ellipsis (`...`) are not shown here but can be found by examining the full source code for this function.
