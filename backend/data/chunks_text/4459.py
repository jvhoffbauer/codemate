- Tests that sending a GET request to /users without 'X-Token' and 'X-Key' headers raises a 422 Unprocessable Entity error with detailed validation errors in the body of the response. - The expected response status is 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and the JSON response contains an object with a 'detail' key containing two dictionaries representing each missing header error. Each dictionary has keys for 'type', 'loc','msg', 'input', and 'url'. These values correspond to the type of error ('missing'), location ('header' followed by the header name), message ('Field required'), input value (None), and URL where this error occurred (match_pydantic_error_url('missing')). This function also handles deprecated Pydantic v1 behavior by returning either the new or old format based on whether it's still needed.
