- Defines a dataclass called `DefaultDependency` that has dictionary unpacking functionality through its `__init__`, `__setattr__`, and `__post_init__` methods (not shown here). - Provides two additional methods for accessing the class's attributes: `keys()` returns all of them as an iterator over string keys, and `__getitem__(key)` returns the value associated with the given key if it exists; otherwise, raises an AttributeError exception. These methods are useful when working with classes whose attribute names may be dynamically generated or derived from external sources, such as configuration files or database queries. By providing these methods, we can avoid having to manually iterate over the class's `__dict__` or use the built-in getattr function to retrieve values, which can lead to more concise and readable code in some cases.
