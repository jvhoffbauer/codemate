- This test case is using `pytest` to run and verify SQLAlchemy's `sqlmodel` feature in Python version 3.10 or higher (marked by `@needs_py310`)
- It imports a specific module called `tutorial005_py310` from the `docs_src.tutorial.one` directory of the project
- The imported module creates an engine instance using the provided URL string and passes it to the `create_engine()` function
- A `Session` object is created within a context manager that raises an exception when no results are found during query execution
- Two TODO comments indicate missing functionality related to deleting objects and adding overloads for executing queries with delete statements
- After creating a new hero record, the `session.commit()` method is invoked to persist changes made to the database
- The `get_testing_print_function()` helper function is used to capture console output generated by the `print()` statement inside the tested module
- Finally, the `patch()` decorator replaces the built-in `print()` function with our custom implementation, which allows us to intercept its usage and store the resulting strings in a list for later verification
