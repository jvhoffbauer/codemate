- Defines a function `get_path_param_min_max_length` that takes an optional argument `item_id`, which is bound to a Pydantic model with minimum and maximum length constraints for its path parameter value. - The returned value of this function is simply the passed in `item_id`. However, since it's being passed into a Pydantic model as a path parameter, it will automatically be validated against the defined minimum and maximum lengths during parsing.
