- This function takes an argument `engine`, which can be of three different types: `SqlalchemyDatabase`, `Engine`, or `AsyncEngine`. - It returns the same object passed as `engine` if it is already a valid database connection or engine instance. - If `engine` is an SQLAlchemy session factory (i.e., `Database` or `AsyncDatabase`), this function simply returns it without wrapping it again in another layer. - Otherwise, if `engine` is an SQLAlchemy engine (i.e., `Engine`), this function wraps it inside a `Database` class to make it compatible with synchronous usage. - Similarly, if `engine` is an async SQLAlchemy engine (i.e., `AsyncEngine`), this function wraps it inside an `AsyncDatabase` class for asynchronous usage. - The function raises a `TypeError` exception if the input `engine` cannot be recognized by any of these cases.
