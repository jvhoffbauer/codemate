- This function takes a `ValidationError` or `RequestValidationError` as input and returns an instance of `InvalidParams`.
- It iterates over all validation errors using list comprehension and removes the 'url' key from each error dictionary.
- If the location ('loc') of the error is within the request body, it updates the 'loc' tuple to exclude the initial 'body.' prefix.
- Otherwise, it checks that there is actually a location specified and adds '<' and the URL path before the remaining location components.
- The updated error dictionaries are appended to a list called 'errors', which is then included in the returned `InvalidParams` object with a 'data' attribute containing {'errors': errors}.
