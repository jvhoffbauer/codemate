- Defines a fixture named `client` for use in pytests using PyTest's built-in fixtures system. - Accepts an argument `session`, which is assumed to be a SQLAlchemy session object. - Creates a function called `get_session_override` that returns the value of `session`. - Sets this new function as the dependency override for the `get_session` method, effectively replacing it with our own implementation during test execution. - Initializes a new instance of FastAPI's `TestClient` class and passes the modified application (with our customized `get_session`) to it. - Yields the newly created `client` object so that other tests can make use of it. - Cleans up by removing the dependency overrides we added earlier.
