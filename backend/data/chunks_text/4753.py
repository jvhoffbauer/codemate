- Defines a function `get_recursive()` that returns a dictionary with two keys, 'name' and'sub_items'. - The value for 'name' is set to 'item', while the value for'sub_items' is an empty list initially. - However, inside the sublist created under'sub_items', there is another nested dictionary with both 'name' and'sub_items' keys defined again. This creates a recursive structure in the returned dictionary.
