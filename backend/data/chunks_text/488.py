- This is a unit test using pytest's `@pytest.fixture(scope="module")` to clear SQLModel's metadata and objects between tests. - Imports the module being tested (`docs_src.tutorial.where`) and sets its URL and engine properties. - Creates a mock function called `get_testing_print_function` which captures print statements during execution of the main function. - Patches the builtin `print` function with the captured mock function. - Executes the main function of the module under test while capturing print statements. - Compares the actual printed output against an array of expected outputs.
