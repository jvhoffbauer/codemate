- Defines an asynchronous context manager using `@contextlib.asynccontextmanager`.
- The function takes a single argument, `_ctx`, of type `JsonRpcContext`. This is likely used to pass additional information or state between functions in the same module.
- Inside the function body, we use the `yield` statement to indicate that this function should be considered a context manager and can be entered and exited with the `async with` statement.
- After the `yield` statement, we raise a custom exception (`HTTPException`) with status code 401. This could potentially be used for authentication or authorization purposes, preventing further execution of the request after the context manager has completed its work.
