- Defines a property called `route_delete` that returns a callable function (a coroutine).
- The returned function is an asynchronous view function for handling HTTP DELETE requests to delete one or more items identified by their IDs.
- Before executing the deletion operation, it checks whether the user has permission to perform this action using the `has_delete_permission()` method of the API class. If not, it returns an error response with status code 401 Unauthorized.
- Otherwise, it calls the `delete_items()` method to actually remove the selected items from the database and returns a JSON response containing the number of deleted items.
