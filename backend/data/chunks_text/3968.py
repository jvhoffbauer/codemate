- Tests if an endpoint is working by making a POST request with JSON data and checking that the expected result (in this case, the sum of the numbers) is returned as JSON in the response body. - Uses Flask's built-in `client` object to simulate requests from outside the application. - Asserts that the actual value returned by the server matches the expected one using Python's built-in `assert` statement.
