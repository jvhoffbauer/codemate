- Generates an OpenAPI schema for a FastAPI application using `client.get("/openapi.json")`.
- The generated JSON contains information about the API's endpoints (`paths`) and their parameters, responses, and schemas (`components`).
- One endpoint is defined with path parameter `{model_name}` and returns a model by name. It has a GET method with a required string parameter named `model_name`, which must match one of the allowed values ("alexnet", "resnet", or "lenet"). The response can be either successful (status code 200) or have validation errors (status code 422), represented as instances of the `HTTPValidationError` class in the `components` section. This error type inherits from Pydantic's built-in `ValidationError` but adds a location array to indicate where the error occurred.
