- This function takes a `User` object as an argument and returns it after checking whether its disabled property is true or false using the `Depends()` decorator to retrieve the currently authenticated user from FastAPI's built-in authentication system (JWT). - If the user is inactive (i.e., has been disabled), this function raises a customized HTTP exception with status code 400 and a detailed error message.
