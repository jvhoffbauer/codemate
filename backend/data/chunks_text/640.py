- This function tests a specific tutorial (tutorial003_py39 in this case) by running it and checking that certain print statements are called using `get_testing_print_function`. - The `create_engine` function is used to connect to an SQLite database at the given URL, which will be used for testing purposes. - A list of expected print statement calls is stored in the `expected_calls` variable, which will be compared against the actual print statement calls made during execution.
