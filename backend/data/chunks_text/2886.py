- This function, named `get_empty`, returns a list containing a single string "OK" when called. - The returned list is empty in terms of data content but not length since it contains one element. - Since an empty list can be created using square brackets ([]), this implementation may seem redundant and unnecessary. However, it could serve as a placeholder for future functionality or provide additional context to the caller about what type of value should be expected from the function.
