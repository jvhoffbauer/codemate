- Defines a function `probe` that takes two dependencies as arguments: `shared_counter`, which is retrieved using the `Depends` decorator and passed to it the result of calling `get_shared_counter()`, and `common_counter`, which is also obtained through `Depends` but with an argument tuple containing both its name (as a string) and value (an integer). - The returned tuple contains all three values: `shared_counter`, `common_counter[0]`, and `common_counter[1]`. This allows us to pass them separately to other functions or views if needed.
