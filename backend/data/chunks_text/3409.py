- Tests if passing a path parameter of '4' for '/path/param-le-ge/{item_id}' results in a HTTP status code of 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and an error message indicating that input should be less than or equal to 3, with URL pointing to `match_pydantic_error_url('less_than_equal')`.
- Alternatively, tests for compatibility with older versions of Pydantic by checking for a different error format containing a `"type"` field of `"value_error.number.not_le"` instead of `"less_than_equal"`. This check will eventually be removed once support for these old formats is dropped.
