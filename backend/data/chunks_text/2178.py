- Defines a GET request for the `"/query/frozenset"` endpoint using FastAPI's decorator syntax. - Accepts a query parameter named `query`, which is of type `FrozenSet[int]`. This data structure ensures that the set cannot be modified after initialization and can be used as an alternative to sets in Python. - Uses Pydantic's `Query()` function to validate and parse the input query from the URL parameters. The ellipsis (...) indicates that we want to use the default validation settings provided by Pydantic. - Returns a comma-separated string containing the elements of the frozen set, sorted in ascending order, and converted to strings using the built-in `map()` and `sorted()` functions.
