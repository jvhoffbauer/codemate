- Defines a function `test_default()` to test the default dependency behavior using the `@dataclass` decorator and `Dependencies.DefaultDependency` base class from the `dependencies` module. - Creates a simple dataclass called `dep` that inherits from `DefaultDependency`. This class has one attribute, `v`, which is an integer. - Asserts that the dictionary representation of the `dep` object with its attributes set in constructor arguments matches the expected result when passed as keyword arguments to the `__init__()` method. - Asserts that accessing the value of the `v` attribute on the `dep` instance returns the same value as was provided during initialization.
