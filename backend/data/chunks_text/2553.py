- This function wraps around the FastAPI application and returns a new asynchronous function that handles incoming web socket connections. - It checks whether the request type is 'websocket' or not using the `scope['type']` attribute. If it's not a websocket connection, it passes the request to the original FastAPI application (with coverage disabled). - Otherwise, it creates a new instance of the `WebSocket` class with the given `scope`, `receive`, and `send` arguments, and calls another asynchronous function called `middleware_func`. The result of this function is returned by the wrapper function.
