- Decorates a function with `functools.lru_cache`, which caches its result for future calls based on input arguments, improving performance by avoiding redundant computations. - Returns an instance of `Settings`, likely representing application configuration or settings. This could be used to avoid loading and parsing these settings repeatedly in different parts of the program, further optimizing resource usage.
