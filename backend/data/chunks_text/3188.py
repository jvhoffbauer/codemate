- Defines a custom JSON encoder for `datetime` objects using Pydantic's `Config` attribute. - Creates two models that inherit from the same base model but have different configuration settings (i.e., one has an empty `Config`, while the other overrides it). - Tests both models with and without the custom JSON encoder to ensure they are properly serialized/deserialized as expected.
