- Defines a fixture named `session` using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture()` decorator. - Accepts an argument called `connection`, which is assumed to be of type `AsyncConnection`. - Uses SQLAlchemy's `AsyncSession` class to create a new database session object with `expire_on_commit` set to False (meaning changes are not automatically committed when the method returns). - Yields this newly created session object for use in tests that require access to a live database connection.
