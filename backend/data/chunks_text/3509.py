- Defines a function `get_client` that creates an instance of FastAPI and returns it as a test client using PyTest's `TestClient`.
- Uses a context manager to suppress deprecation warnings related to the use of `Form` for parsing query parameters in FastAPI versions prior to 0.75.
- Defines a route handler `read_items` that accepts a query parameter named 'q', which is validated against a regular expression pattern ('^fixedquery$') using the `Annotated` decorator from Pydantic. If the query parameter is present, the response includes its value concatenated with a greeting; otherwise, a generic greeting message is returned.
