- This fixture is automatically called by PyTest before each test function using `autouse=True`. - It returns an instance of a `Database` object named `sync_db`, which can be used in tests that require synchronous database access. - After the test, the fixture cleans up any open connections to the database by closing the connection pool (ignoring mypy's warning about the dynamic attribute name).
