- This test disables OpenAPI by setting the `OPENAPI_URL` environment variable to an empty string using `monkeypatch`. - The `get_client()` function is called again to load the updated configuration with the disabled OpenAPI feature. - Four requests are made to verify that resources related to OpenAPI (e.g., `/openapi.json`, `/docs`) return a 404 error status and appropriate text responses.
