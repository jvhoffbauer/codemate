- Overrides the `__bool__()` method of the object to provide a custom truth value based on its internal `value`. - Returns `True` if the `value` is not equal to false, otherwise returns `False`. - Allows for more intuitive and consistent boolean operations with objects that have an underlying boolean state represented by their `value`.
