- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items` that takes a default argument `commons`, which is obtained using the `Depends()` decorator and passed to it the dictionary returned by the `common_parameters` function. - The function returns the value of the `commons` parameter, which contains common parameters for multiple functions in the application. This allows reusing these parameters instead of passing them repeatedly to each function.
