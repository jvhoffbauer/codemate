- This function returns the current Flask session object, which can be used to store and retrieve data across multiple requests from a user's browser. - The `get_session_override()` function is called by Flask when it needs to access the session, but if we want to use a different implementation of sessions for testing or other purposes, this function allows us to override the default behavior provided by Flask. - By returning the existing `session` variable in our application context, we are using the built-in Flask session functionality without any modifications.
