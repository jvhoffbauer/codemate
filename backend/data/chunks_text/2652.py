- This endpoint returns a single item with name 'coerce' and price '1.0', represented as a string instead of a float, using FastAPI's `response_model` decorator to automatically convert the JSON response body into a Python object (in this case, an Item instance). - The `@app.get()` decorator is used to define a GET request handler for the specified URL path ('/items/coerce'). - The `response_model` parameter specifies that the expected response format should be an Item object, which will be automatically deserialized from the incoming JSON data by FastAPI.
