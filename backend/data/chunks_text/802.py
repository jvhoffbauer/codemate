- This function retrieves a specific refresh token from the database using SQLAlchemy's `fetch_one()` method and the `refresh_tokens` table defined in another part of the application. - The query is constructed with an equality condition on the `refresh_token` column to match the input parameter passed to the function. - If the query returns a row (i.e., the specified refresh token exists), it is returned as a dictionary containing all columns; otherwise, `None` is returned.
