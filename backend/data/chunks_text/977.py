- This function takes several arguments to customize how it generates JSON schemas for a list of model fields. - It returns a tuple containing two dictionaries: one with validation and serialization definitions for each field, and another with input/output definitions for each model (if `separate_input_output_schemas` is true). - The `get_flat_models_from_fields()` helper function is called to flatten the nested structure of related models into a single list of all involved models.
