- This function handles a specific web socket connection for an item with ID `item_id`.
- It retrieves the current route (URL path) from the scope of the request and sends it along with the item ID to the connected client via JSON message.
- The function waits for the initial handshake (`await websocket.accept()`) before sending any data.
