- Tests synchronous endpoint `sync_sync_raise_other`, which raises an error from a dependency (`OtherDependencyError`) and asserts that another synchronous endpoint (`sync_raise`) has completed successfully without any errors. - Uses PyTest's `pytest.raises()` context manager to catch the expected exception raised by the tested function. - Asserts that the second synchronous endpoint completes successfully, but also checks if it was not marked as an error in the list of errors returned by the server.
