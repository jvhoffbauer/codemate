- Tests if accessing non-existent path `"/path/int/foobar"` returns a HTTP status code of 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and displays a specific error message related to invalid input for int type parsing. - Uses Pytest's built-in fixture `client` to simulate making a GET request to the server using Flask's testing client. - Asserts that the JSON response body contains a dictionary with a list containing one item representing the validation error, which includes details such as the error type, location in the URL path, error message, and original input value.
