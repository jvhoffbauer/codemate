- Generates the OpenAPI schema for the FastAPI app using the `get_openapi()` function from FastAPI's internal module.
- Stores the resulting dictionary as an attribute of the app instance (`self`) so subsequent calls can be avoided.
- Allows customization of the schema through various parameters passed to `get_openapi()`. See FastAPI documentation for details.
