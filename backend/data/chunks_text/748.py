- Defines a method `build_url` that takes three arguments (class instance, value to be converted, and metadata about the conversion). - Checks whether the input value is already an instance of `URL`. If so, returns it as is. - Otherwise, creates a dictionary with string representations of non-null values from the metadata. - Returns a new `URL` object initialized with the created dictionary.
