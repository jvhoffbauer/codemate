- Defines a function called `validation_exception_handler` that takes in two arguments - `request` and `exc`. This function is asynchronous (indicated by the `async` keyword).
- Prints an error message to the console using string formatting when an exception related to client input validation occurs (represented by the `exc` variable).
- Calls another function named `request_validation_exception_handler`, passing it both the original `request` object and the current `exc` instance. This allows for further handling of the exception if needed.
