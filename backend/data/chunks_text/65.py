- This function `get_annotations()` takes a dictionary `class_dict` as input and returns another dictionary containing annotations for that class. - It uses the built-in `resolve_annotations()` function to extract annotations from two sources: the `__annotations__` attribute of the class (if present) and its module name (optional). - The returned dictionary may contain any valid Python object as value for each key representing annotation names.
