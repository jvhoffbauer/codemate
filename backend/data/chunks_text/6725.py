- Defines a function `check_event` that takes an event as input and returns None (implicitly).
- Inside this function, it defines another helper function called `check_string_keys`. This function recursively checks whether all keys of a given dictionary are strings or not.
- The main function then uses the context manager `capture_internal_exceptions()` to catch any internal exceptions raised during the execution of `check_string_keys()`, which is called on the passed event object.
