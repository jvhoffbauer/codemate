- This function tests the `client` object defined in a module called `tutorial001_py310`. It makes an HTTP GET request to the URL `"/users/"`, passing query parameters `"q"="foo"`, `"skip"="100"`, and `"limit"="200"` using the `client`'s built-in methods for handling these arguments. - The expected status code of the response is checked against the actual value received. If they don't match, an error message containing both values is printed. - The JSON content of the response is extracted and compared with a predefined dictionary that contains the same data as well as some additional information about the original query parameters passed during the request.
