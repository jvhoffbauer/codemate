- This function is a GET request for retrieving items from the API endpoint `"/items/"`. - It uses FastAPI's dependency injection system to pass an OAuth2 access token (stored in the environment variable `OAUTH2_ACCESS_TOKEN`) as a parameter named `token`, which can be used to authenticate and authorize requests made by this function. - The response returned by this function contains just the passed token value wrapped inside a dictionary with a key "token".
