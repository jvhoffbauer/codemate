- Defines a function `model_config_attr` that takes three arguments: `model`, which is an instance of Pydantic's BaseModel class; `name`, which is the attribute to retrieve from the Config object associated with the given model; and `default`, which is an optional value to use if the specified attribute doesn't exist in the Config object. - The function returns either the value of the named attribute on the Config object for the provided model or the default value passed as an argument, depending on whether the attribute exists or not. This allows for more concise configuration options by avoiding repetitive boilerplate code when defining models using Pydantic.
