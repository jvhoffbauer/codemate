- Registers an admin interface for `models.Article` with customized behavior and fields using Flask-Admin's decorator syntax. - Defines a subclass of `admin.BaseAuthFieldModelAdmin`, which provides authentication and authorization features for Django models. - Sets up readable fields (i.e., those that can be viewed but not edited) by passing a list to the `read_fields` attribute. - Specifies editable fields (i.e., those that can be updated or created) based on their permissions using a dictionary in the `perm_fields` attribute. The keys are enum values representing view, update, and create permissions, respectively; the corresponding values are lists containing field names.
