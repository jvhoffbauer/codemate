- Defines a function `fake_save_user` that takes an argument of type `UserIn`.
- Inside the function, it creates a hash value for the password using `fake_password_hasher()`, which is not a real password hashing algorithm but just a placeholder in this case.
- It then converts the input dictionary `user_in` to a new dictionary with keys renamed to match the database schema (`UserInDB`) and adds the hashed password as a new key called `hashed_password`.
- Finally, it prints a message indicating that the user was successfully saved, although in reality, no actual saving or persistence happens here.
