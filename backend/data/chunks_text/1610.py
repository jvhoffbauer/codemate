- Defines a function called `override_get_db` that takes no arguments and returns nothing (i.e., it's a generator function)
- Inside the function, tries to create an instance of `TestingSessionLocal`, which is likely some sort of database connection object for testing purposes
- Yields the created database connection object so that it can be used in other parts of the program without having to explicitly call `override_get_db` every time
- Finally, closes the database connection when the function exits or raises an exception
