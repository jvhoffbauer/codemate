- Defines a function called `on_event` that takes two arguments: `event_type`, which is a string representing the type of event (either'startup' or'shutdown'), and returns a callable function that can be used to decorate other functions with event handling capabilities. - Provides documentation explaining what `event_type` represents and its possible values ('startup' or'shutdown'). - Deprecates the usage of this function in favor of using FastAPI's built-in lifespan events system, as explained in the provided link to the official FastAPI documentation.
