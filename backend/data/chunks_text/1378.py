- This endpoint returns a single item with an ID that is greater than or equal to the current item being viewed (assuming items are ordered by some sort of ID). - It uses FastAPI's `response_model` decorator to specify the expected format of the returned data as a Python class representing the Item model. - The function simply returns a hardcoded JSON object containing the desired item properties.
