- Defines an asynchronous generator function `asyncgen_state_try()` that takes a default argument of type `Dict[str, str]`, which is obtained using the `Depends()` decorator and passed to the `get_state()` function. - Inside the function body, it sets the value of the key `'/async_raise'` in the dictionary `state` to a string representing the start of the operation. - The function then enters a `yield` statement with an exception handler block (`except AsyncDependencyError:`). If this exception occurs during execution, its name is added to a list called `errors`. - After completing the `yield` statement, the function cleans up by setting the value of the same key back to another string indicating successful completion.
