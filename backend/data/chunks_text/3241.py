- Endpoint `GET /by-alias/list` returns a list of models with their aliases using FastAPI's built-in JSON serialization and deserialization features (Pydantic). - The returned data is annotated as having type `List[Model]`, where `Model` represents any Pydantic model defined in the application. This allows for automatic validation, documentation, and error handling based on the schema of each individual item in the list.
