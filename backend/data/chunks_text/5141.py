- Defines a method `get_route_handler` that returns a callable function for handling HTTP requests based on defined routes in FastAPI. - Creates a new function called `custom_route_handler` which wraps the original route handler returned by `super().get_route_handler()`. - Uses the `rasterio.Env` context manager to set up environment variables required by RasterIO, such as GDAL and PROJ libraries paths. - Returns the newly created wrapped function instead of the original one. This allows us to modify the behavior of specific routes without affecting others.
