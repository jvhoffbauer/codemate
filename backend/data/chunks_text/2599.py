- Generates an OpenAPI schema for a FastAPI application using `client.get("/openapi.json")`.
- Asserts that the status code is 200 and checks the JSON content of the response against expected values.
- Defines the structure of endpoints (e.g., paths) with their request methods (e.g., GET, POST), responses, summary, operation ID, and request body schema.
- Includes definitions for data types used in requests or responses (e.g., Item).
- Uses Pydantic's validation error handling to define custom error messages and structures.
