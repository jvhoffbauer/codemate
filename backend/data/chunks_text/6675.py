- Defines a fixture named `probe` that takes an instance of FastAPI's EndpointManager (`ep`) as input. - Registers a new endpoint method with the given name and parameters using the `Endpoint.method()` decorator. - The returned value from this function is assigned to the `probe` variable, which can be used in other tests or functions. - The `Depends()` function is used to pass a dependency (in this case, `get_jsonrpc_request_id`) into the endpoint method. This allows for more complex dependencies between endpoints and test cases.
