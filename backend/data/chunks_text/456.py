- This is a unit test for the `docs_src.tutorial.where` module's `tutorial001` function using SQLModel and SQLAlchemy ORM. - It sets up an in-memory SQLite database connection and creates a testing print function to capture output during execution. - The main function of the module is called inside a context manager that patches the built-in `print` function with the testing one. - Finally, it checks if the expected result (a list containing a dictionary representing a single record) was printed by the tested function.
