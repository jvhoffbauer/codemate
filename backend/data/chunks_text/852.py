- Defines a function called `decorator` that takes in a decorated callable (a function with decorators applied to it) as an argument and returns it. - Inside the function, adds a new route for WebSocket API endpoints using the FastAPI's built-in `self.add_api_websocket_route()` method. - The arguments passed to this method include the path of the endpoint, the decorated callable itself, an optional name for the endpoint, and any required dependencies. - By returning the original decorated callable, we can continue chaining decorators without breaking functionality or causing conflicts.
