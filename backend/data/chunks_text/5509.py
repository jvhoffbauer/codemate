- Takes a byte array `content` representing an image, reads it using Python's built-in memory file object (MemoryFile), and returns its metadata in dictionary format. - The function is named `parse_img`, which suggests that it parses or extracts information from an image. - It uses the `with` statement to ensure proper resource management of both the memory file and the open file objects inside it.
