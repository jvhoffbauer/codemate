- This function `test_tutorial` is testing a module called `tutorial001` in the `docs_src.tutorial` package using pytest's `clear_sqlmodel` fixture to clear SQLModel's metadata before each test. - The `create_engine` function from SQLAlchemy is used to create an engine for connecting to a SQLite database specified by the `sqlite_url`. - A mock object `new_print` is created using `get_testing_print_function` and passed to `patch` to replace the built-in `print` function during the execution of the tested module (`mod.main()`) so that its output can be captured and checked later.
