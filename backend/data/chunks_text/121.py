- Defines an overloaded function called `select` with three arguments: a tuple of two iterable types (`__ent0` and `__ent1`) and a scalar value (`entity_2`). The first argument is ignored for this specific implementation. - Returns a new class called `Select`, which takes a tuple as its input containing elements from both original tuples and the specified scalar value. This allows selecting specific values based on certain conditions or criteria.
