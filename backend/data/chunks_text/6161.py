- Defines a function `docker()` that takes several arguments related to building and running Docker containers. - Raises an error with a message and exit code of 1 if neither `--build` nor `--run` is specified. - Builds the Docker image using the command `docker build.`, then runs it using the command `docker run -p 80 --name <generated_name> <image_tag>`. Alternatively, just runs the container without building it first using the command `docker run -p 80 --name <generated_name> <image_tag>`. The generated name includes a random number between 0 and 999 for uniqueness.
