- This unit test checks if making a GET request to `/items/` without any query parameters returns the expected response (i.e., "Hello World"). - The `get_client()` function is used to create an instance of Flask's testing client, which allows us to simulate HTTP requests and responses for testing purposes. - The `assert` statement is used to verify that the status code and JSON response match our expectations.
