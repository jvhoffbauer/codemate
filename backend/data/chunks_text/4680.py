- This function tests the `POST /files/` endpoint by uploading a file using Flask's built-in testing client (TestClient).
- The temporary directory provided by pytest is used to create and write a new text file containing some sample data.
- The file object is passed as an argument in the request body under the key 'file'.
- The server returns a JSON response that includes the size of the uploaded file.
