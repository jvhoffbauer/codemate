- This function tests sending a notification to an email address and logging its execution.
- If a file named 'log.txt' exists, it is deleted before running the test (skipped by coverage tool).
- The function sends a POST request to '/send-notification/foo@example.com', expects a status code of 200, and checks that the JSON response contains the expected message.
- It also reads the contents of 'log.txt' after the request and verifies that they contain a specific string indicating successful notification delivery.
