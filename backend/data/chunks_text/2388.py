- Defines a function `get_client` that creates an instance of FastAPI and returns it as a test client using the `TestClient` utility provided by Starlette. - Imports necessary modules such as `FastAPI`, `Pydantic`, and `Starlette`. - Creates a new model called `Rectangle` which is derived from Pydantic's `BaseModel`. This model has two fields for storing the width and length values respectively. - Adds a computed field to the `Rectangle` model named `area` which calculates the product of the `width` and `length` attributes. - Exposes a route at the root path (/) with a GET request handler that returns an instance of the `Rectangle` model initialized with some default values.
