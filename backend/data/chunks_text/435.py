- This function `test_tutorial` is testing a module called `tutorial001_py310` in the `docs_src.tutorial` package using pytest's `clear_sqlmodel` fixture to clear SQLModel's metadata before each test. - The `create_engine` function from SQLAlchemy is used to create an engine for connecting to a SQLite database specified by the `sqlite_url`. - A mock object `new_print` is created using `get_testing_print_function` and passed to `patch` to replace the built-in `print` function during the execution of the tested module (`mod.main()`). - After executing the module, the content printed to standard output is captured by the `new_print` mock object and stored in the list `calls`, which should contain one element containing two lists representing the arguments passed to print. - Finally, the expected output is checked against the actual output by comparing the contents of the `calls` list with the hardcoded value.
