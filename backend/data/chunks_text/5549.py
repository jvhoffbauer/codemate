- This function takes a `field` argument that can be an instance of three different classes (`InstrumentedAttribute`, `Column`, or `Label`) representing SQLAlchemy database fields. - The function tries to extract the Python type of the expression associated with the given field using its `type` attribute. - If the extracted Python type is either `datetime.datetime` or `datetime.date`, the function returns one of two helper functions called `parse_datetime` and `parse_date`. These functions are used later in the program for parsing string representations of dates/times into their corresponding Python types. - Otherwise, if no specific handling is required for the extracted Python type, the function simply falls back to returning plain strings as parsed values.
