- Initializes a `Database` object named `sync_db`.
- Yields the initialized database for use in other functions or blocks of code using a generator function.
- Closes and frees up the connection pool resources associated with the `sync_db` after it has been yielded to prevent resource leaks. (Note that we're ignoring the mypy warning about closing an already closed connection here because this is part of a larger context manager, which will ensure that the connection isn't actually closed until all operations are complete.)
