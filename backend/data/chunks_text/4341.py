- This function uses `aiohttp`'s `TestClient` to simulate a request for an item with ID 'baz'.
- The expected status code is checked against the actual one received from the server. If they don't match, the error message includes both codes and responses.
- The JSON response body is compared against the expected values using Python's built-in `assert`. Any discrepancies will cause the test to fail.
