- This function tests sending a notification using Celery and Redis by making an HTTP request to the `/send-notification` endpoint of the Flask application defined in `docs_src.background_tasks.tutorial002_py310`. The email address 'foo@example.com' is passed along with a query parameter 'q'. - Before executing the test, it checks whether a file named 'log.txt' exists and deletes it (only for testing purposes). - After receiving a successful response from the server, it reads the contents of the newly created 'log.txt' file and verifies that the message has been logged correctly.
