- Defines a fixture named `client` using pytest's built-in `fixture()` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which returns an instance of FlaskTestClient for the application defined in `docs_src/schema_extra_example/tutorial005_an_py39`. - This allows us to easily test our API endpoints by injecting this client into other tests as needed.
