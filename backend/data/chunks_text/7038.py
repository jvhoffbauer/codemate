- This endpoint allows users to initiate a password reset process by providing their email address. - The `crud.user.get_by_email()` function from the `app.cruds` module is used to retrieve the user with the provided email address from the database. - If the user exists in the database, a new password reset token is generated using the `generate_password_reset_token()` function and sent via email using the `send_reset_password_email()` function defined elsewhere in the application. - A message is returned indicating that an email will be sent if the provided email is associated with a user account in the system.
