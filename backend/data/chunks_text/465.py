- This is a unit test for the `docs_src/tutorial/where.py` module using Pytest's `clear_sqlmodel` fixture to clear SQLModel's metadata before each test. - The `import` statement imports the specific function (`tutorial006`) from the `where` submodule of the `tutorial` package in the `docs_src` directory. - The `create_engine` function from SQLAlchemy is called and assigned to the `engine` attribute of the imported module. - A mock object named `new_print` is created by calling `get_testing_print_function`, which patches the built-in `print` function during the execution of the test case. - The main function of the imported module is executed within a context manager that patches the `print` function with the newly created mock object. - Finally, an assertion checks whether the list of arguments passed to the patched `print` function matches the expected output based on the data provided in the test case.
