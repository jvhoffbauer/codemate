- Defines a GET request for the `/items/` endpoint using FastAPI's decorator syntax (`@app.get`)
- Accepts an optional query parameter named `q`, which is of type `List[Item]` and has a default value of `None`. This parameter can be passed to the function as a result of calling the `Query()` function from Pydantic, which allows us to define complex data structures with validation rules. In this case, we are defining a list of items that will be used in our search filtering logic. If the user doesn't provide any filters, then the default value of `None` will be used instead. - The `pass` statement is used here because we haven't implemented the actual functionality yet; it serves as a placeholder until we add more code later on. However, note that this line should not appear in your final implementation since it won't contribute anything useful to the program.
