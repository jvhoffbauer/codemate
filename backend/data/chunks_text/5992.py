- Tests for `field_annotation_is_scalar()`, which checks if a given type or annotation represents a scalar value (i.e., not a sequence or mapping).
- Scalar types tested include strings, integers, datetime objects, and optional wrappers around them.
- The function also handles union and literal types as scalars.
- Tests for `field_annotation_is_scalar_sequence()`, which checks if a given type or annotation represents a sequence of scalar values.
- Sequence types tested include lists, sets, tuples, and optional wrappers around them.
- Tests for `field_annotation_is_complex()`, which checks if a given type or annotation represents a complex object (i.e., not a scalar or sequence).
- Complex types tested include custom classes, dictionaries, and list/set comprehensions.
- Testing for origin of generic types using `get_origin()`.
- Tests for `field_annotation_is_sequence()`, which checks if a given type or annotation represents a sequence (i.e., can be indexed with integer keys).
- Sequence types tested include lists and sequences containing nested models.
