- This function `on_event()` adds an event handler to a FastAPI router and is marked as deprecated. - It takes an argument `event_type`, which can be either'startup' or'shutdown'. - A new decorator called `decorator()` is defined inside this function that wraps around the provided callback function (`func`) and returns it after adding it as an event handler using the `self.add_event_handler()` method. - The message "Add an event handler for the router." is displayed when calling this function with a callback function. - However, the documentation suggests replacing this functionality with the newer `lifespan` events system introduced by FastAPI.
