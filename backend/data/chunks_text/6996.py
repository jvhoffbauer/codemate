- Defines a method `update` that takes three arguments: a database session (`db`), an instance of the model being updated (`db_obj`), and data to be used for updating the object (`obj_in`)
- Extracts the fields from the input dictionary using Pydantic's `UpdateSchemaType`, excluding any unset values
- Iterates over each extracted field and checks whether it exists as an attribute on the database object (`db_obj`)
- If the field is found, sets its value to the corresponding value from the input dictionary; otherwise raises an `AttributeError` with an error message indicating which field was not found
- Adds the modified object back into the database session, commits the changes, and refreshes the object to ensure all updates are reflected
- Returns the updated object
