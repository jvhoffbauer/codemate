- This function named `statistics()` takes multiple dependencies passed through the `@Dependency()` decorator from other functions in this module. These dependencies include file paths, parameters for specific layers and images, statistical calculation options, and environment variables. - The function uses the `rasterio.Env()` class to set up an environment object that can be used by RasterIO's readers and writers. It passes any necessary environment variables using keyword arguments. - Inside a context manager created by the `with` statement, it opens the input data source (specified by `src_path`) using the `Reader()` method of the `RasterDataset` class provided by RasterIO. Any additional parameters required by the reader are also passed via keyword arguments. - Finally, the function returns the result of calling the `statistics()` method on the opened data source, passing along all relevant parameter values.
