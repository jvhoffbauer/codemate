- Initializes a dictionary `counter_holder` to store the value of the global counter and sets it to zero. - Makes an HTTP GET request to the endpoint "/scope-counter/" using Flask's built-in testing client (client). - Asserts that the status code is 200 OK and saves the text response for debugging purposes. - Retrieves the JSON response body and asserts that the 'counter','scope_counter_1', and'scope_counter_2' keys are present with expected values. - Repeats steps 2-4 but makes another GET request without clearing the cache or resetting any variables. - Asserts that the new response has updated counters based on previous requests.
