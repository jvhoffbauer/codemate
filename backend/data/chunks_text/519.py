- This function tests a specific section of SQLAlchemy's documentation (tutorial004 in connect.select). - It uses `pytest-mock` to replace the built-in print statement and capture its output, which is stored in the `calls` list for later comparison against an expected set of outputs. - The `create_engine` method is called with a hardcoded URL for a local SQLite database, allowing us to ensure that this part of the tutorial works correctly without having to actually interact with a remote server or database.
