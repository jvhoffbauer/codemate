- Defines a method `has_page_permission()` that takes three arguments: `request`, `obj`, and `action`. The first two are required while the third one is optional. - If `self.app` (which represents an instance of this class) is equal to `self` (meaning it's being called from within this same object), then return true. This allows for recursive calls without causing infinite loops. - Otherwise, call the `has_page_permission()` method on the app instance with the provided arguments, and return its result.
