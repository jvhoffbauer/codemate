- Defines an overloaded function called `select` with three arguments: `entity_0`, `entity_1`, and `__ent2`. The second argument is ignored by PyCharm's static analysis tool (type hinted as `ignore`) to avoid false positives in some cases. - Returns a generic class named `Select` that takes three type parameters: `(_TScalar_0, _TScalar_1, _T2)`. This class represents a tuple containing two scalar values of types `_TScalar_0` and `_TScalar_1`, along with another value of type `_T2`.
