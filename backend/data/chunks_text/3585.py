- Defines a Pydantic model for the `data` parameter using the `Union` and `Header` classes from Pydantic's `httpv` module to allow both string and none values with custom headers defined in JSON Schema and OpenAPI formats. - Provides two example headers ("json_schema_header1" and "json_schema_header2") that can be used when generating documentation or testing requests. - Includes detailed descriptions of each header (including summary and description) as part of its definition within an OpenAPI dictionary called `openapi_examples`. This allows developers to easily understand how to use these headers in their own applications.
