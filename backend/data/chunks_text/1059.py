1. Defines a function `request_params_to_args` that takes two arguments - `required_params`, which is a sequence of model fields, and `received_params`, which can either be a dictionary, query parameters, or headers.
2. Initializes an empty dictionary called `values` to store validated parameter values and an empty list called `errors` to store validation errors.
3. Loops through each required parameter using a generator expression from `required_params`. For scalar sequences like lists or tuples, it retrieves their values from the query parameters or headers instead of the dictionary passed as argument. Otherwise, it gets the value directly from the dictionary.
4. Retrieves the location tuple containing the input type and name of the current parameter being processed.
5. If the parameter's value is missing and it's mandatory, adds a missing field error to the `errors` list; otherwise, sets its default value in the `values` dictionary.
6. Validates the parameter's value against its data type and constraints using the `validate()` method defined by the corresponding model field. The result is stored in `v_` variable, while any errors are added to the `errors` list.
7. If there were errors during validation, they get appended to the `errors` list with updated locations based on the original location tuple.
8. Finally, returns both the `values` dictionary and the `errors` list after all required parameters have been processed.
