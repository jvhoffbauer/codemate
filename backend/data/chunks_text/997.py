- This function checks whether a given Python annotation represents a sequence of bytes, such as `bytes`, `bytearray`, or tuples containing these types. - It recursively traverses union types (i.e., ORs), looking for any argument that satisfies the condition. If found, it returns true immediately without further checking. - For non-union types, it first checks whether the type itself is a byte sequence using another helper function called `field_annotation_is_sequence`. - Then, it iterates over each element of the sequence and verifies that they are either plain bytes or non-ASCII bytes represented by the `NonAscii` class from the standard library's `collections.abc` module.
