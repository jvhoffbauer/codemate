- Defines a function `make_app()` that takes an optional argument `app` and keyword arguments `**kwargs`. If `app` is not provided, it creates a new instance of `FastAPI` with the given keywords. - Adds three routers to the application using the `include_router()` method. The first router (`router`) is added without any prefix, while the second router (`prefix_router`) is added with a custom prefix "/prefix". The third router (`native_prefix_route`) is also added with its own native prefix. - Returns the modified application object for use elsewhere in the program.
