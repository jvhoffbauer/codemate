1. Defines a fixture named `client` using PyTest's built-in fixtures decorator, `@pytest.fixture`. This allows us to reuse setup logic across multiple tests.
2. Takes an argument called `session`, which is provided by another fixture or function that we haven't seen yet. We'll call this `Session` object later in our test.
3. Creates a helper function called `get_session_override` that returns the value of `session`.
4. Adds the `get_session_override` function as a dependency override for the `get_session` function within our Flask application instance. This ensures that our custom `session` value will be used instead of the default one during testing.
5. Initializes a new `TestClient` with our modified Flask application and saves it to the `client` variable. The `yield` keyword passes control back to PyTest so other functions can use this fixture.
6. Yields the `client` object back to PyTest, allowing it to be used in subsequent tests.
7. Clears out any remaining dependency overrides after the test has completed.
