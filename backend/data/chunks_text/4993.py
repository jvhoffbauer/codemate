- Defines a class method `all` for the current model (represented by `cls`) that returns either a queryset of instances or a list of them, depending on whether it's called in a database context or not. - The implementation simply calls the built-in `QuerySet.all()` method and returns it as is, without any further processing. This allows clients to use this method interchangeably with calling `ModelName.objects.all()`, but with the added benefit of being able to call it outside of a database transaction if needed.
