- Defines a function `get_current_active_user()` that takes an optional argument `current_user`, which is retrieved using the `Security` wrapper and the `get_current_user()` method from FastAPI's security middleware. - Checks whether the active status of the user (retrieved through `crud.user.is_active()`) is true or false. If it's false, raises a customized HTTP exception with a status code of 400 and a detailed error message. - Returns the current user object as output.
