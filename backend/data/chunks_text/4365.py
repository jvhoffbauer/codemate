- Defines a fixture named `client` using pytest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called by pytest when it encounters this fixture in tests that use it. - Inside the `get_function()`, we first import the Flask application object (`app`) from a specific module within our project's documentation sources (`docs_src.additional_status_codes.tutorial001_an_py310`). - We then create a new instance of Flask's built-in test client (`TestClient`) with our imported `app`. - Finally, we return the newly created `TestClient` instance so that it can be used in other functions or classes that require an HTTP client for testing purposes.
