- Defines a function `test_openapi_schema` to test the OpenAPI schema of our FastAPI application.
- Makes an HTTP GET request to the `/openapi.json` endpoint using the `client` object provided by PyTest and checks if the status code is 200. If not, it asserts with the error message from the response text.
- Parses the JSON response and compares it against expected values for the root keys (OpenAPI version, info dictionary, paths dictionary).
- Checks that the `PUT /items/{item_id}` path has the correct summary, operation ID, parameter(s), responses, and content types. The `HTTPValidationError` schema is referenced in the `422` response's content type.
