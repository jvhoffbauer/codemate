- Uses FastAPI's dependency injection to pass query parameters (`q`) as an argument to the function.
- Validates the length and format of the `q` parameter using Pydantic's `Query` decorator.
- Returns a dictionary with two items ("Foo", "Bar") by default, but also includes the value of `q` in the response if it is provided.
