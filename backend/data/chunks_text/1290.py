- This function is a FastAPI endpoint with an `@app.post` decorator and a path of `"/uploadfiles/"`. - It takes a single argument, `files`, which is a list of `UploadFile` objects obtained from FastAPI's built-in `File` class. The `description` parameter specifies that multiple files can be uploaded at once. - Inside the function body, we extract the filenames of each uploaded file using list comprehension and return them as a dictionary keyed by "filenames".
