- Defines a generator function `session` that uses SQLAlchemy's `SessionLocal` context manager to create and manage database sessions for use within other functions or methods. - Yields each created session object, allowing it to be used by other parts of the application without having to explicitly call `session.commit()` or `session.rollback()`. - Helps ensure consistent and efficient database access patterns by automatically committing changes made during a single request/response cycle (i.e., "request scope") while also providing rollback functionality in case an exception is raised.
