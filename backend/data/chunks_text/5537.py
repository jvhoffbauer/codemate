- Retrieves Pydantic model schema based on SQLAlchemy `Inspect` object of a given table model class
- Checks whether the table model itself or its attribute `__pydantic_model__` (if present) is already a subclass of Pydantic's `BaseModel`. If so, returns it directly. Otherwise...
- Extracts column names using `TableModelParser`, which is an external helper function that we don't see here
- Creates corresponding Pydantic fields based on extracted columns and sets them as attributes of the table model with name `__pydantic_model__`
- Returns the newly created Pydantic model
