- Defines a fixture named `db` at the session scope using PyTest's built-in `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - Creates and returns a new SQLAlchemy database session (`Session`) for each test run, which is automatically closed after all tests have finished executing within that session. - Allows other fixtures or tests to access this shared database connection through dependency injection.
