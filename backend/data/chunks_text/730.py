- Tests different values for `uuid_length` and verifies that the current ID is correctly truncated or left intact based on the value of `uuid_length`. - Uses Celery's built-in `UUID('')` function to generate a UUID string. - Sets the `celery_current_id` global variable using Python's built-in `uuid4()` function. - Verifies that the `CeleryTracingIdsFilter` class filters out the `celery_current_id` attribute from the log record unless it falls within the specified `uuid_length`, which is either provided as an argument or defaults to 36 if none is given.
