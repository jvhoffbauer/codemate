- Defines an async function `create_upload_files()` that takes a parameter `files`, which is annotated with both `list` and `File`. This allows us to pass either a single or multiple `UploadFile` objects. - The `File` annotation specifies metadata about the argument, such as its name ("Multiple files as UploadFile"). - Inside the function, we extract the filenames of each uploaded file using list comprehension and store them in a dictionary called "filenames".
