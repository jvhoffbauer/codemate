- Defines a function `custom_enum_encoder` that takes an enum object as input and returns its value in lowercase format. - Creates a new enum type called `MyEnum`. - Initializes an instance of `MyEnum` and passes it to `jsonable_encoder`, along with a dictionary containing our custom encoder for `MyEnum`. - Asserts that the resulting JSON representation is equal to what we would get by calling our custom encoder directly on the instance.
