- Defines a function `process_items` that takes in two arguments: `items_t`, which is a tuple containing three elements of type `int` and `str`, and `items_s`, which is a set containing bytes. - The function returns a tuple with the same structure as the input tuple (i.e., `items_t`) and a new set called `items_s`. No modifications are made to either argument within the function body.
