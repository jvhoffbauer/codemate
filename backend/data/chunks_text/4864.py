- This endpoint is accessed using a POST request to `"/login/test-token"`. - The user's access token is automatically included in the request headers by FastAPI's authentication middleware (JWTBearer). - The `Depends()` decorator retrieves the authenticated user from the database and passes it as an argument to the function, which returns the same user object for testing purposes.
