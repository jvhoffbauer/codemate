- Defines a class method called `__get_validators__`, which returns an iterable of validator functions for this class. - The `yield` keyword is used to return multiple values from the function, in this case, a single validator function named `validate`. - This method is required by Pydantic's built-in validation system and should be implemented by all custom models that use Pydantic for data validation.
