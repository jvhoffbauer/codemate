- This function is an asynchronous method called when a FastAPI application receives a new HTTP request. - It checks whether the incoming request type is 'http'. - If it is, it creates a `Request` object from the given `Scope`. - It defines a variable to store the decoding format (here, Latin-1). - It iterates over all key-value pairs of the request's query parameters and concatenates them into a string with lowercase keys and values separated by '=' and '&', excluding the last character ('&'). - The resulting query string is stored in the `request.scope['query_string']`, which can be accessed later during the processing of the request. - Finally, it passes control back to the main app using `await self.app(...)`.
