- This function is an asynchronous generator that streams data from a request's body using `async for`.
- It yields each chunk of data received from the request's stream to its caller, allowing it to process the data incrementally instead of waiting for the entire response to be received at once.
- The `yield` statement returns control back to the event loop until more data becomes available or the connection closes, making this method efficient and non-blocking.
