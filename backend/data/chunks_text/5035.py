- Initializes a producer object and starts its execution asynchronously using the `asyncio` library's `await` keyword. - The `start_producer()` method is responsible for starting the Kafka producer, which will send messages to the specified topic at regular intervals. - This function returns immediately without waiting for the producer to finish executing, allowing other tasks in the program to continue running concurrently.
