- Defines a retry decorator using `retrying` library that retries function calls up to a specified number of times (`max_tries`) with a fixed delay between attempts (`wait_seconds`) and logs informational messages before each attempt and warning messages after failures. - Initializes a database connection by getting the default bucket from Couchbase and storing it in a variable called `bucket`. An informational message is logged indicating successful establishment of the connection. - Waits for the API to become available by running a simple authentication test (`test_get_access_token()`) and raises an exception if any errors occur during this process. The error message is logged at the ERROR level.
