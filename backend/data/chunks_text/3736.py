- Sets up a temporary directory for testing SQL databases using PyTest's `temp_path_factory`. - Changes working directory to the newly created temp path and creates a new database file named 'test.db'. - Imports the `test_sql_app` module, which contains tests for interacting with SQL databases, but defers execution until after the database is created. - Reloads the imported module to ensure any necessary setup or initialization occurs before running tests. - Runs one specific test (`test_create_user`) within the imported module. - Deletes the temporary database file at the end of the test run.
