- Defines a function called `session_fixture()` that creates an SQLAlchemy engine and metadata, sets up connection parameters for multi-threading, and creates all necessary tables using SQLModel's `create_all()`. - Yields the created database session to be used in tests. - Uses StaticPool instead of ThreadLocalSession to avoid thread safety issues when running multiple tests concurrently.
