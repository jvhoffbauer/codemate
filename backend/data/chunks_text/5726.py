- This function is called to retrieve the schema for a specific page in an application built using Amis (a low-code development framework). - It first checks whether there's already a schema available by calling `super().get_page_schema()`. If so, it updates some properties of that schema and returns it. - Otherwise, it creates a new `PageSchema` object with the URL of the current page as its base path, and sets up an API endpoint for making requests to this page. The response from this endpoint will be cached for 5 minutes. - Finally, depending on the parsing mode set for the page ("html"), it adds an `Iframe` component to the schema that loads the HTML content of the page at the specified URL.
