- Defines an asynchronous function `create_multiple_images` that takes a list of `Image` objects as input and returns them after some processing (presumably). - The function is marked asynchronous using the `async` keyword, indicating that it may contain async/await statements to await I/O operations or other long-running tasks. - This function could be used in conjunction with an API endpoint that accepts multiple image files at once for batch processing, saving storage space, and reducing server load compared to making individual requests per file.
