- This function tests the validation error that occurs when posting data with an invalid size field (in this case, 'XL') using the Flask-Restful's `client` object and making a POST request to the '/items/' endpoint. - The expected status code for this scenario is 422 (Unprocessable Entity), which indicates that the server understands the content type of the request entity but was unable to process it due to its format being incorrect. - The response text and JSON body are checked against two possible scenarios: either the current version of Pydantic or the previous one (which will eventually be removed). In both cases, the error message returned by Pydantic is parsed and compared against some predefined values.
