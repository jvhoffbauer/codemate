- Defines a function called `test_typing` that tests different data type inputs and responses using FastAPI's `TestClient`.
- Creates a dictionary of expected inputs (keys are type annotations) with corresponding values.
- Loops through each key-value pair in the dictionary and creates a new instance of FastAPI.
- Defines a new endpoint with the specified input parameter and output model (response schema).
- Makes a POST request to the endpoint with the expected input as JSON payload.
