- Imports `tutorial001_py310` module from the documentation sources and runs its main function, capturing print statements for testing purposes using a custom printing function provided by Pytest. - Sets up an SQLAlchemy engine connected to a local SQLite database at the given URL. - Defines a helper function that wraps the built-in `print` statement and saves each printed message in a list of calls for later comparison against expected output. - Patches the built-in `print` statement with this wrapper during the execution of the imported module's main function. - Asserts that the captured call list matches the expected output after running the tests.
