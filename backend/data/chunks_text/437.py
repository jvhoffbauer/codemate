- Imports `tutorial006` module from the `docs_src.tutorial` package and assigns it to a variable named `mod`.
- Sets the SQLAlchemy connection URL for the `mod` object using the `sqlite_url` attribute.
- Creates an SQLAlchemy engine instance using the `create_engine()` function and sets it on the `mod` object.
- Initializes a list called `calls` to store print statements made during execution of the `main()` method in the `mod` object.
- Retrieves the built-in `print()` function and replaces it with a custom implementation that captures its arguments and stores them in the `calls` list.
- Calls the `main()` method of the `mod` object within a context manager that restores the original `print()` function after the call completes.
- Asserts that the `calls` list contains exactly one tuple representing the output printed by the `main()` method, which should match the expected format shown in the bullet point.
