- This test case is part of a tutorial in SQLAlchemy's documentation and tests the `select_heroes()`, `create_table()`, and `drop_tables()` functions defined in the `docs_src/tutorial/one/tutorial005_py310.py` module using Pytest fixtures to manage database connections and testing output. - It creates an engine connected to a SQLite database at `sqlite://`, executes the tutorial's main function (which raises a NoResultFound exception), then adds a new hero record to the session and commits it. - The test uses Pytest's monkeypatching feature to replace Python's built-in print statement with a custom implementation that captures its output in a list called `calls`. - Finally, the test runs the `select_heroes()` function while replacing the standard print statement with our custom one, verifying that the expected output is captured correctly by checking if the `calls` list contains the correct data.
