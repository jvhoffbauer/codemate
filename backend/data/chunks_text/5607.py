- Defines a method called `AnnotatedItemIdList` in the current class (presumably a FastAPI endpoint)
- The docstring explains its purpose as an annotated list of item IDs with permissions filtering and FastAPI dependency injection support
- Returns an instance of `Annotated`, which is a type hint for Pydantic's validation system, specifying that it should be a list of strings and can be injected using the `Depends` decorator with the `filtered_item_id` parameter from another function or object
