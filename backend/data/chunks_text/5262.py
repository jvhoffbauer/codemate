- This method, named `mediatype`, returns the media type of an instance's associated file based on its filename extension using the `MediaType` class from Django's built-in `django.core.files.images`. - The returned value is stored in a variable called `value` within the `MediaType` class, which can be accessed by indexing with the name of the media type (e.g., 'image/jpeg'). - By returning this value, we can easily determine the appropriate content type for serving or processing the associated file.
