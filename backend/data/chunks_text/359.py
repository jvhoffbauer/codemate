- Tests the `Session.query()` method to retrieve a single row from the database using SQLAlchemy's ORM (Object Relational Mapping) and SQLModel library for type annotations and schema generation. - Uses the `pytest.warns()` context manager to capture deprecation warnings that may be raised during the execution of the test case. - Asserts that the retrieved object is not null and checks if its name matches the one previously inserted into the database.
