- Defines a custom function `broken_operation_id()` to generate unique operation IDs for routes instead of using the default one provided by FastAPI. - Creates an instance of FastAPI and passes the custom function as argument to its constructor. - Defines three endpoints (`/`, `/second`, and `/third`) that all have the same request body type (`Item`). - Uses the `TestClient` class from FastAPI's testing module to make requests against the application. - Catches any warnings raised during the execution of the tests using Python's built-in `warnings` module. - Filters out all warnings except those related to user input or configuration errors using the `simplefilter()` method. - Makes a GET request to retrieve the OpenAPI specification JSON file. - Asserts that two warnings were raised, both being instances of the `UserWarning` class. - Checks if the second warning message contains the string "Duplicate Operation ID".
