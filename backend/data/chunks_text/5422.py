- Retrieves the bounds (spatial extent) of a MosaicJSON dataset using FastAPI's dependency injection mechanism to pass in necessary parameters for reading and processing the data. - Returns the bounds as a dictionary containing four coordinates representing the north, south, east, and west extents of the dataset. - Uses RasterIO's Env context manager to manage environment variables required by the dataset's back-end storage system.
