- Tests if requesting `/path/bool/foobar` returns a status code of 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and an error message containing details about the invalid boolean value 'foobar'. - Uses Pytest's built-in fixtures `client` and `match_pydantic_error_url` for making requests and generating URLs from pydantic errors respectively. - Asserts that the JSON response contains either the new or old format of the error message depending on whether Pydantic version 1 is still being used.
