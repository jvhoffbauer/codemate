- Defines a function `deep_data()` that takes an optional argument `data`, which is a list of `DataItem`. If no value is provided, it uses the default value specified by `Body(...)`. - Returns the input `data` without any modifications or transformations. This function can be used to recursively traverse nested lists and dictionaries in Python, as long as each element contains a `__dict__` attribute (i.e., it's a dictionary). The `deepcopy()` module can then be used to create a new copy with modified values while preserving the structure of the original object.
