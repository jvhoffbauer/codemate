- Creates a temporary copy of `fake_database`, which is used to return a value from the generator function and update the original database in case of success. - Yields the temporary database, allowing it to be consumed by the caller. - Tries to execute some code that may raise an HTTP exception (presumably making a network request). If this happens, sets a flag in the global `state` dictionary. - Regardless of whether or not there was an error, executes cleanup code in the finally block, setting another flag in `state`.
