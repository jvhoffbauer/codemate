- Tests for handling MosaicNotFoundError, which is not being done correctly in current implementation (raises MosaicError instead)
- Returns a status code of 424 (Unprocessable Entity), which may need to be changed to 404 (Not Found) if implemented properly
- Uses Flask's `app.get()` method with query parameters to simulate requesting a mosaic JSON file that doesn't exist
