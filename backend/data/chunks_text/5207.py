- This function named `available_bands()` takes three dependencies - `src_path`, `reader_params`, and `env`. The first dependency is obtained using `Depends(self.path_dependency)`, which means it's being passed through from another part of the application (presumably). The second dependency is also obtained via `Depends()`, but this time it's coming from `self.reader_dependency`. Lastly, we have `env`, which is again obtained using `Depends()`, but in this case, it comes from `self.environment_dependency`.
- Inside the function body, we create an instance of `rasterio.Env` using the `env` dictionary that was passed to us. We then open our input file using `self.reader()` and pass both `src_path` and `reader_params` as arguments. By doing so, we can access the opened dataset inside the context manager using the variable name `src_dst`.
- Finally, we simply return the list of band names for the opened dataset using the `bands` attribute of the `DatasetReader` object.
