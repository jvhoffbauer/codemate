- This function `get_user()` retrieves a specific user from the database using FastAPI's dependency injection and SQLAlchemy ORM (crud). It takes two arguments - `db` which is an instance of the database session provided by `Depends`, and `user_id` which is the ID of the desired user to retrieve.
- If the requested user is not found in the database, it raises a customized HTTP exception with a status code of 404 Not Found and a detailed error message. Otherwise, the function returns the found user object.
