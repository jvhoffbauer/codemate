- Defines a property called `route_submit` for this class (presumably a subclass of FastAPI's BaseModel). - The property returns an asynchronous function named `route`, which takes in a request object and a schema instance representing the expected input format. This is decorated with `@property`. - Inside the `route` function, the `handle` method of the current object is invoked with the request and input data, returning its result. Again, this is wrapped in an asynchronous context using `async`/`await`.
