- Defines a GET endpoint for retrieving user information and associated data using FastAPI's decorator syntax (@app.get)
- Uses dependency injection to pass in two arguments (user_data and data) to the function
- The user_data argument is secured with the get_user function and requires both 'foo' and 'bar' scopes as defined by OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- Returns a dictionary containing the user's details, their authorized scopes, and any related data obtained through another dependency (get_data)
