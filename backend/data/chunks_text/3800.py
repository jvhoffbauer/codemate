- Tests if a GET request to "/portal" with parameter "teleport" returns a temporary redirect (HTTP status code 307) and sets the location header to a specific YouTube video URL ("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ") without automatically following the redirection. - Uses Flask's built-in `TestClient` class for testing HTTP requests locally. - Asserts that the expected behavior is met by checking the HTTP status code and location header of the response object returned by the `get()` method of the `TestClient`.
