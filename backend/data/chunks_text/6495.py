- Initializes the `OpenAPIApp` class by calling its parent's `setup()` method and setting up any necessary variables (e.g., `openrpc_url`, `title`, `version`)
- Checks that required variables are set before adding an OpenRPC route to the app's routing table using FastAPI's `add_route()` function
- Defines a new asynchronous function called `openrpc()` which returns the OpenRPC specification in JSON format
- Registers the `openrpc()` function as a route with the specified URL path (`openrpc_url`) and sets the `include_in_schema` flag to False to prevent it from being included in the Swagger UI generated by FastAPI
