- This method is a class method for sorting the timeline history of an object before saving it to the database using Django's built-in `ModelAdmin`. - It takes in the `value` argument which represents the dictionary containing the key-value pairs representing the timeline events. - The sorted() function is used to sort the items based on their keys and then convert them back to a dictionary format using the dict() constructor.
