- Defines a decorator function `ep_method_auth` that takes an endpoint object (`ep`) as input and returns it with a new method called 'probe' added to it using FastAPI's built-in `@endpoint.method()` decorator. - The `probe` method is decorated with another dependency, `Depends(auth_user)`, which retrieves the authenticated user from the request headers or cookies using the `HTTPBasicCredentials` class provided by FastAPI for basic authentication. - The `probe` method returns the username of the authenticated user, allowing us to verify their identity in subsequent requests without requiring them to provide credentials again.
