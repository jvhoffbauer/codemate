- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()` that takes a query parameter `q`.
- The `Query` decorator is used to validate and sanitize user input for the `q` parameter with a minimum length of 3 characters.
- If the `q` parameter is not empty, it's added to the dictionary `results` under the key 'q'. Otherwise, it's skipped.
- Finally, the updated `results` dictionary is returned from the function.
