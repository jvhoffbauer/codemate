- Defines a function called `no_response_model_no_annotation_return_model` that returns an instance of the `User` class with name "John" and surname "Doe". - The `User` class is not explicitly defined in this snippet, implying it's imported from another module or defined elsewhere. - This implementation doesn't use type hinting (annotations) for the returned value, but still follows PEP8 naming conventions by using camelCase for the function name.
