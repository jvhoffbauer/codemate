- Defines a function `not_` that takes either a SQLAlchemy column expression or any compatible value as an argument (`Union`) and returns a new SQLAlchemy element representing the NOT operation on it. - Imports the necessary functions from SQLAlchemy's built-in module to perform the NOT operation, which is then wrapped in our own function for convenience. - The `# type: ignore[arg-type]` comment at the end of the line is used to suppress a mypy warning about the type signature being too general; this is because we want to allow both expressions and values as arguments, but mypy can't infer their exact types without more context.
