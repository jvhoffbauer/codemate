- This function takes in a username, password, and optional host and port parameters to connect to a Couchbase server using the `Cluster()` class from the `couchbase-core` library. - It returns an authenticated `Cluster` object that can be used for further operations on the database. - The `get_cluster_couchbase_url()` helper method is not shown here but it constructs the URL based on the provided host and port values.
