- This method is called automatically when an object of this class is used in a loop or sequence context (e.g., for x in obj). - It should return an iterator, which provides one value at a time from the object being iterated over. - Since we're not implementing iteration here, we're raising an exception to indicate that our class doesn't support iteration and shouldn't be used as a sequence or iterable.
