- Defines a retry decorator using the `retry` function from the `retrying` library with specific parameters for maximum attempts, waiting time between retries, and log messages before and after each attempt. - Wraps the `init` function with this decorator to automatically retry it up to a certain number of times if an exception is raised during initialization, with configurable delays and logging behavior in between attempts.
