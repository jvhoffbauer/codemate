- Endpoint for user login authentication with a `POST` request to `/login`.
- Uses FastAPI's built-in dependency injection system (Pydantic models and OJETO) to validate input data using the `sys_user_schema.UserPhoneAuth` model.
- Simplified implementation of login functionality that can be replaced by more complex business logic in a separate file called `UserLogic()`.
- Generates an access token using FastAPI's built-in security module (jwt) with an expiration time specified in settings.py. The token contains the user ID.
