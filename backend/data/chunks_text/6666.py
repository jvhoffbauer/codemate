- This function is a middleware that intercepts JSON RPC requests and responses using `jsonrpc` library's context manager. - It keeps track of request IDs in a dictionary called `_calls`. - Inside the try block, it yields to allow other functions to execute before raising an exception with a unique marker for debugging purposes. - In the finally block, it adds another tuple containing relevant information about the request, response, and exception to the corresponding request ID list in `_calls`.
