- This method is an asynchronous function that returns a SQL `Select` object. - The `request` parameter is not used in this implementation and can be omitted. - The `get_select()` method retrieves all entities from the `_select_entities` dictionary (presumably populated elsewhere) using Python's built-in `values()` method, and passes them to the constructor of the `Select` class to create a new query object.
