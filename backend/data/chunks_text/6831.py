- Initializes a SQLAlchemy database session and defines a function `init_db` that takes in this session as an argument. - Checks whether the first superuser exists by querying the database using SQLAlchemy's `select` method. If the user doesn't exist, creates it using FastAPI's CRUD operations (CrudOperations class from Pydantic-SQLAlchemy). - The `Base.metadata.create_all` statement is commented out because table creation is handled through Alembic migrations instead of directly creating them here. This ensures consistency between development and production environments where migration scripts are executed during deployment.
