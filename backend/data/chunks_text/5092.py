- Defines a function `test_get_path` that takes in an instance of Flask's testing client (`health_client`) and some input parameters for the API endpoint being tested (`path`, `expected_status`, and `expected_response`).
- Makes a GET request to the specified endpoint using the provided client object (`resp = health_client.get(path)`), and asserts that the response status code matches the expected value (`assert resp.status_code == expected_status`).
- If the response status is successful (i.e., HTTP 200 OK), then it checks whether the JSON body returned by the server matches the expected response (`if resp.status_code == 200:`). This can be useful when testing APIs that return complex data structures or arrays.
