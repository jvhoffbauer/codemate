- Defines a function `create_body_model()` that takes two arguments, `fields` and `model_name`.
- Uses Pydantic's `create_model()` to generate an empty base class called `BodyModel`, with the given `model_name`.
- Loops through each field provided in the `fields` sequence using a list comprehension (not shown).
- Adds each field to the `BodyModel` dictionary of attributes by assigning it directly to the corresponding key. This is done despite a warning from mypy about indexing into an unsubscriptable object; this appears to be safe because we are modifying our own object here.
- Returns the generated `BodyModel` class.
