- Defines a property called `route_page` that returns a callable function named `route`.
- The `route` function is an asynchronous view function that takes two arguments - `Request` and `page`, which is annotated with our custom `AnnotatedPage` class (ignored for now).
- Returns the result of calling another method `page_parser` on the current object (presumably the main class this property belongs to), passing in the `Request` and `page` objects.
