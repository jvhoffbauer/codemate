- Enables testing of redirect slash behavior with FastAPI and Pytest by creating a custom application instance (FastAPI) with `redirect_slashes=False`.
- Defines an endpoint using an APIRouter object that returns a string message when accessed.
- Includes the defined router in the main application instance.
- Uses the built-in Pytest TestClient to make requests against the application endpoints while disabling automatic redirection for trailing slashes.
- Verifies that accessing the endpoint without trailing slashes results in a successful HTTP status code (200), whereas attempting to access it with trailing slashes generates a not found error (404).
