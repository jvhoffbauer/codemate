- Defines a function `test_algo` that tests dependencies for an algorithm in Titler's core module.
- Imports and uses `default_algorithms`, which is assumed to be a list of available algorithms.
- Creates a FastAPI application with a dependency on `PostProcessParams`.
- Defines an endpoint that returns parameters based on the requested algorithm.
- Tests the endpoint without any query parameter, expecting no result.
- Tests the endpoint with an invalid algorithm name (`hillshad`) and expects a 422 status code.
- Tests the endpoint with a valid algorithm name (`hillshade`) and expected parameters.
- Tests the endpoint with customized algorithm parameters passed through query string.
