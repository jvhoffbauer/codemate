- This function handles PUT requests to update an existing item with a specific ID (specified by `item_id`) in the app's database.
- It allows for optional query parameters that can be passed as JSON body using FastAPI's `Body()` decorator. These include:
  - `start_datetime`, which specifies when the item should begin processing. If not provided, defaults to None.
  - `end_datetime`, which specifies when the item should stop processing. If not provided, defaults to None.
  - `repeat_at`, which specifies how often the item should be processed. If not provided, defaults to None.
  - `process_after`, which specifies how long after starting processing the next iteration of the item should occur. If not provided, defaults to None.
- The function calculates and returns several additional fields based on these input values:
  - `start_process`, which is the actual start time of processing once any necessary delays have been accounted for.
  - `duration`, which represents the total length of time between the beginning and end of processing.
