- This function, named `probe`, returns a string representing the username stored in the variable `credentials_var`.
- The type annotation specifies that this function will always return a string (`-> str`) and the keyword `return` is used to explicitly state what value should be returned when the function is called.
- The `credentials_var` object is assumed to contain some sort of authentication information, such as login credentials or API keys, which can be accessed using the `get()` method. In this case, we're specifically interested in the `username` attribute of these credentials.
