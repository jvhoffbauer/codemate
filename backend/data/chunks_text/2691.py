- This endpoint returns a dictionary with a key `"name"` and value `"John"` as the response body, but it is annotated to have no specific schema using `response_model=None`. - However, the function still returns an instance of the `User` class (which has been defined elsewhere in the application), which causes a type error at runtime because the returned dictionary cannot be automatically converted into that class. - To avoid this issue, you should either remove the `-> User:` annotation or define a custom model for the response body instead of relying on automatic conversion.
