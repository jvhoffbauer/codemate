- Creates a generator function `client` that returns an instance of `AsyncGenerator`.
- Initializes variables for the server's IP address and port number.
- Defines a dictionary called `scope` containing a single key-value pair representing the client's identity.
- Uses the `TestClient` class from FastAPI to create a new test client object with the initialized app and scope.
- Yields the newly created test client object back to the caller using the `yield` keyword in Python.
