- This fixture is automatically called by PyTest before each test using `autouse=True`. - It returns an instance of `AsyncDatabase`, which provides asynchronous access to a database. - The fixture yields this object, making it available in tests that use it with `conftest.py`. - After all tests have finished executing, the fixture closes and frees up the connection pool resources used by `AsyncDatabase`.
