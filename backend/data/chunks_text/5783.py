- Overrides `get_page()` method of Django's built-in `ModelAdmin`.
- Retrieves the current page object using `super().get_page()`.
- Sets the body content of the page to be the result of calling `get_list_table()` on the current instance (i.e., this class). This is likely a custom list table implementation for displaying data from the model being administered by this admin class.
