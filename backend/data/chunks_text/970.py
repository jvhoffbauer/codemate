- Checks whether a given `ModelField` represents a scalar value that can be part of a Pydantic version 1 (PV1) sequence, such as a list or tuple. - First checks if the shape of the field matches one of the shapes allowed by PV1 sequences (e.g., "list", "tuple"). - Then ensures that the field's data type is not a subclass of `BaseModel`, which would indicate that it contains nested models instead of simple values. - If the field has any child fields (i.e., sub-fields), recursively checks each one to ensure they are also valid PV1 scalars. - Finally, checks whether the field's data type itself is a sequence using an internal helper function called `_annotation_is_sequence()`.
