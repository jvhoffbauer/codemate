- Defines a function called `route` that is asynchronous (`async`) and takes two arguments: `Request` object representing HTTP request and an argument named `item_id`, which is a list of IDs for items to be processed, annotated with `Admin.AnnotatedItemIdList`. - The third argument, `data`, is optional and represents the body of the request, annotated with both `Body()` decorator and `Schema()` class from Pydantic library. This allows us to validate the incoming JSON payload against our defined schema. - Returns the result of calling another method `handle()` passing in the `Request` object, `item_id` list, and `data` if provided.
