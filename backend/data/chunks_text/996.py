- Checks whether annotation is a subclass of `UploadFile`, which represents file upload objects in Flask-WTF forms. - If the annotation's type is a union (representing multiple possible types), recursively checks each argument to see if any are instances of `UploadFile`. - Otherwise, returns false as it's not a valid `UploadFile` or non-obligatory `UploadFileAnnotation`.
