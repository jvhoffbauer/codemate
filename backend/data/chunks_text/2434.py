- This function is a dependency resolver that takes an optional argument `state`.
- If the value of `state` is equal to "generator raise started", it raises another exception called `OtherDependencyError`.
- The `Depends` decorator from FastAPI's dependency injection system is used to pass the `state` parameter to this function.
