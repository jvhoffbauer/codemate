- Defines a class method called `__get_validators__` for this class (`cls`)
- Yields a function named `validate`, which will be used as a validator when creating instances of this class using the `dataclasses.make_dataclass()` function or decorating it with `@dataclass`. This is done by calling `dataclasses.fields(...)` and passing in the name of the validation function, i.e., `'validate'` here.
