- Defines a function called `select` with four arguments (`entity_0`, `__ent1`, `entity_2`, and `entity_3`) of specific types (_TScalar_0, _TCCA[_T1], _TScalar_2,_ and _TScalar_3_, respectively). The first argument is ignored due to annotation `type: ignore`. - Returns a new object of type `Select` that takes tuple as input containing all the passed arguments in the same order. This allows for easy chaining of multiple selections.
