- This function `gettext` is a method of an object (implicitly passed as `self`) and takes two arguments `value` and `language`. If `language` is not provided, it defaults to another attribute `_language` of the same object. - The decorator `@lru_cache()` is used to cache the result of this function based on its input parameters. This can improve performance by avoiding repeated computations for the same inputs. - Inside the function body, the current `language` is first checked against a dictionary `_locales` that contains translations for different languages. If the current language is found in this dictionary, then each translation object `trans` associated with that language is iterated over. For each such translation object, the `_catalog` attribute containing the actual translated text is accessed using Python's built-in `__dict__` attribute. Finally, the `gettext` method of the selected translation object is called with the given `value`, which returns the desired localized string.
