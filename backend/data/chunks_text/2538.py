- Defines a FastAPI web socket endpoint with the name `router_ws_depends_validate`.
- Uses the `@asyncdef` decorator to define an asynchronous function.
- Accepts two arguments: a `WebSocket` object representing the incoming connection and a dependency called `data`, which is obtained using the `Depends()` decorator and passed to the `ws_dependency_validate()` function for validation.
- The body of the function (`pass`) is currently empty but will contain the actual implementation of the web socket handler once it's added.
