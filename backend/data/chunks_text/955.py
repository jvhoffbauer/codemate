- Defines a function `get_compat_model_name_map` that takes in a list of model fields as an argument and returns a dictionary called `ModelNameMap`.
- The returned dictionary is empty by default, indicating no compatibility mapping between models is needed. This can be overridden in subclasses or custom implementations if necessary.
