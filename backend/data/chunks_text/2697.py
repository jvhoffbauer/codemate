- This endpoint returns a `User` object without specifying a response model annotation (i.e., `response_model=None`) but still includes extra data in the returned submodel (in this case, `DBUser`, which is defined elsewhere). - The use of `response_model=None` allows for more flexibility in defining custom responses that may not fit neatly into Pydantic's built-in models or require additional context beyond what can be represented by a simple schema. However, it also requires careful consideration and documentation to ensure consistency and maintainability across endpoints.
