- This method is called `get_multi` and returns a list of objects of type `ModelType`.
- It takes two arguments, `db` (a SQLAlchemy session object) and optional keyword arguments `skip` and `limit`, which default to zero and one hundred respectively.
- The function checks that the value of `limit` doesn't exceed 500, as this could lead to performance issues with very large datasets.
- Finally, it uses SQLAlchemy's query builder to retrieve all matching records from the database, starting at an offset specified by `skip` and limiting the result set to `limit` items using the `offset()` and `limit()` methods respectively.
