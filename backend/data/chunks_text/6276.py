- Tests the `/<STATE>/` endpoint for a specific state (in this case,'recovered') using an ASGI client and mocking datetime functions to simulate a specific date. - Compares the JSON output of the API call against a predefined JSON file ('expected_json_output'). - Uses the `mock` library to replace certain methods or attributes of modules that are difficult to control in unit tests. In this example, it replaces the `datetime` module's `utcnow`, `ISOFormat`, and `strptime` methods to provide more predictable behavior during testing.
