- Defines an asynchronous function `get_item()` that takes a required integer argument named `item_id`, which can also be passed in through a URL path with a default value of 1 if not provided. - The `@anndecorator` syntax is used to decorate the parameter with Pydantic's `Path` validator, which provides additional validation and parsing functionality for URL parameters. In this case, it ensures that the `item_id` is a positive integer and converts any incoming string or query parameter values into integers automatically.
