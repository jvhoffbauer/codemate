- This function returns an instance of `config.Settings`, which is likely a class containing configuration settings for the application or module. - The use of the `get` prefix in the function name suggests that it's retrieving some kind of data, and specifically settings in this case. - Since there are no arguments passed to the function, it can be called without any parameters, making it easy to access the settings object from other parts of the program.
