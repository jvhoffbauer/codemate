- Registers table models from `app_mod` and `test_mod` using SQLModel's auto-registration feature, which creates necessary database tables if they don't exist yet. - Reloads modules `app_mod` and `test_mod`, ensuring that any changes made to these modules are reflected during testing. - Called automatically before each test case by PyTest's `autouse` attribute, making it a convenient place for common setup logic.
