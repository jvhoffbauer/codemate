- Retrieves information about a specific MosaicJSON dataset using its path and optional parameters for readers and backends. - Dependencies are passed to the function through arguments, including the path of the dataset, parameters for readers and backends, and environment variables. - The `with` statement is used to create a context manager that handles opening the dataset, setting up dependencies, and closing resources automatically. - Finally, the `info()` method of the opened dataset object is called and returned as JSON format using the `response_model`.
