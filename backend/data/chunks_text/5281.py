- Creates a FastAPI application with multiple routes and handlers.
- Adds the `CacheControlMiddleware` to set default caching behavior for responses.
- Excludes specific paths (routes starting with "/route1", "/route2", or matching the regex pattern "/tiles/[0-1]/.*") from being cached by setting their own custom headers instead of using the middleware's defaults.
- Tests the middleware by making requests to different endpoints and checking that the expected HTTP headers are present in the responses.
