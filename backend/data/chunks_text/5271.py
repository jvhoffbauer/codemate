- This method is called `get` and takes a string argument named `name`. It returns an instance of the base class `BaseAlgorithm`.
- If the provided `name` is not present in the dictionary stored in the object's `data` attribute, it raises a `KeyError` with an error message containing the value of `name`.
- Otherwise, this method simply returns the corresponding algorithm from the `data` dictionary using the given `name` as the key.
