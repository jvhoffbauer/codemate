- Tests the `/tilejson` endpoint by making requests with different parameters and verifying expected responses in terms of JSON structure and URL generation for tile sources. - Uses a patch decorator to replace the RasterIO module's open function with a mock implementation (`mock_rasterio_open`) during testing. This allows us to control how the CSV file is opened without actually reading it from disk or interacting with external resources. - Verifies that the generated tiles follow the specified format and scale, as well as any customization options such as color maps provided through query parameters.
