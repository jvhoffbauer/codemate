- Returns an `Item` object with a valid value for `aliased_name`, but excludes any unset fields from being serialized in the response body using the `response_model_exclude_unset` parameter. - The `price` field is still included since it has a valid value. - This can be useful to prevent unnecessary data transfer and improve API performance by reducing the size of responses.
