- Defines a fixture named `health_client` with session scope using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - Creates an instance of Flask's built-in `ApiClient` class and passes in the application object (`app`) as an argument to initialize it. - This fixture will be available for all tests within this test session, which is equivalent to running all tests in one go or invoking the command `python -m pytest`.
