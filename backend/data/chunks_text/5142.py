- Defines a function called `custom_route_handler` that takes in a request object and returns a response object asynchronously using the `async def` syntax. - Uses the `with` statement to create a context manager for RasterIO's environment variables, passing in self.config (presumably an instance variable containing configuration options). - Calls the original route handler (assuming this is part of some larger framework or application) and saves its result in a variable named'response'. - Returns the saved response object.
