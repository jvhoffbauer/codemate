- Defines a function called `test_algo` that tests the dependency injection feature of FastAPI using the `Dependency` decorator and the `Algorthms` class from the `fastapi-algos` package. - Registers the `Multiply` algorithm with the default set using the `register` method of the `default_algorithms` object. - Creates an instance of the FastAPI application and defines a simple endpoint that takes an optional parameter for the algorithm to use. If no algorithm is specified, it returns the maximum value in the image without applying any transformation. Otherwise, it applies the selected algorithm and returns its result. - Uses the `TestClient` class provided by FastAPI to make requests to the server and verify their behavior. The first request simply retrieves the maximum value in the image without applying any transformation. The second request tries to access the `multiply` algorithm without specifying the required factor, resulting in a 400 Bad Request error. The third request successfully invokes the `multiply` algorithm with a specific factor and verifies that the returned data matches the expected result.
