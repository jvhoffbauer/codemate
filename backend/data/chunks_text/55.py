- This function takes a `field` parameter of any type and returns its metadata using PyDantic's built-in `metadata` attribute. - It first iterates through all the metadata objects associated with the given field (using Python's `for` loop). - If it finds an object that is an instance of PyDantic's `PydanticMetadata`, it immediately returns this object as the result. - Otherwise, it falls back to returning a custom implementation called `FakeMetadata`.
