- This function retrieves a GraphQL response from GitHub using provided settings and parameters. - It sends an HTTP POST request to the specified URL with authorization header and JSON body containing query, variables (including optional `after` and `category_id`) and operation name ("Q"). - If the status code of the response is not 200 or there are errors in the response, logs an error message and raises a runtime error with the text of the response. - Otherwise, returns the parsed JSON response as a dictionary.
