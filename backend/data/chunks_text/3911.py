- This test uses `TestClient` from FastAPI to simulate a request to the `/items/` endpoint with no query parameters specified. - The expected status code is 200 and the text of the response body should be ignored for this test. - The JSON response returned by the server should contain two default values ('foo' and 'bar') in its 'q' key.
