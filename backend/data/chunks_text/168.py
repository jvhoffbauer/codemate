- Defines a function `col` that takes in an argument `column_expression` of type `_T`. This is used as a generic type to allow for any SQLAlchemy column expression. - Checks whether the input `column_expression` is an instance of either `ColumnClause`, `Column`, or `InstrumentedAttribute`. If it's not, raises a `RuntimeError` with an error message. - Returns the `column_expression` without changing its value. The `type: ignore` comment is added because mypy complains about the return statement being unused since we don't assign the result back to anything. However, this function is meant to be called inside other functions where the returned value will be assigned to something else.
