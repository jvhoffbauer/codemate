- Defines a `UserFilter` model to filter user data based on ID or username. - Registers a `UserCrud` object with SQLAlchemy and sets its `router_prefix` and `schema_filter`. - Includes the generated CRUD routes into the main application using the registered crud's `router`. - Tests that the OpenAPI documentation doesn't include the password field for the filter schema. - Makes API requests with different filters (ID and username), verifying that they return the expected results.
