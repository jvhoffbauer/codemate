- This function is a PUT request handler for updating a specific user with ID `id`.
- It takes in two arguments: `request`, which contains the new values to be updated using FastAPI's built-in `UserUpdateIn` model, and `id`, which is the primary key of the user being updated.
- The function retrieves the existing user from the database using `ORMUser.get(id)`.
- It then creates a new instance of `User` (the domain object representing a user) by passing the incoming request data into its constructor via `User.from_orm(request)`.
- Next, it updates the original user object with the fields specified in the incoming request using Python's dictionary merge operator `**`.
- Finally, it applies the changes made to the user object back to the database using `await user.update().apply()`.
- Afterwards, it returns the updated user as an instance of `User` using `User.from_orm(user)`.
