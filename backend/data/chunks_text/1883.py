- This function, `read_items`, is a GET request handler for the URL path "/items/" in our FastAPI application. - It returns a list of two `Item` objects as JSON response when this endpoint is accessed. - Each item has a `name` and an optional `description`. The `Item` class is defined elsewhere in our app's module or package.
