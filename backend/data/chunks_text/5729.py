- Defines a property called `AnnotatedPage` that returns an instance of `Annotated`, which is a type hinting and validation tool in FastAPI. - The returned value is a tuple containing two elements: `Page` (the actual data type being passed) and `Depends(self.get_page)` (a function to retrieve the required page). This allows for easier dependency injection into other functions or routes using this property as a parameter.
