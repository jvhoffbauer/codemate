- This function, `test_value_extracting_by_ws`, tests extracting a value using WebSocket (WS) in Flask's built-in testing framework. - It connects to the WS endpoint "/ws" and receives a JSON message containing the value "42". - The received value is then compared against an expected value of "42", which should be equal if the WS connection and data extraction are working correctly.
