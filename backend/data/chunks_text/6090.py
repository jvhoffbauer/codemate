- Defines a function `app` that returns an instance of FastAPI with a middleware added to it using the `add_middleware` method. - The middleware used is `BaseHTTPMiddleware`, which is provided by SQLAlchemy's ASGI integration (sqlalchemy-asyncio). - This middleware dispatches requests to the database connection pool managed by SQLAlchemy's ASGI extension (db.asgi_dispatch), ensuring efficient and scalable handling of multiple concurrent connections.
