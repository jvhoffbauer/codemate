- Defines a dataclass named `GenerateJsonSchema` with an attribute called `ref_template`. - The `@dataclass` decorator is used to automatically generate __init__(), __eq__(), and __post__() methods for this class based on its attributes. - The `type: ignore[no-redef]` comment is added because the `dataclass` decorator redefines the built-in `dataclass` function, which can cause a warning in some IDEs or linters. By providing this comment, we tell these tools that we're aware of the potential issue and want them to suppress it.
