- This function is an asynchronous (async) method that returns a list of users related to the currently authenticated user (stored in `current_user`) using the `get_current_user()` decorator from FastAPI's dependency injection system (Depends). - The returned value is stored in a variable called `read_users_me`, which can be used elsewhere in the application by passing it as a parameter to other functions or methods. - By returning the current user object itself instead of querying for additional data, this function provides a simple and efficient way to retrieve information about the user's own account without requiring any external dependencies or database queries.
