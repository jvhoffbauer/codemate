- This is a class decorator that adds a validation method to check URLs for trailing slashes. - The `valid_url_` function takes a string argument representing the URL and returns it with or without a trailing slash based on whether it already has one. - If the URL ends with a forward slash (i.e., "http://example.com/"), this function removes the last character (the slash) before returning the modified URL.
