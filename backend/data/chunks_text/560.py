- Imports a module named `mod` from the `docs_src/tutorial/relationship_attributes/create_and_update_relationships` directory and sets its SQLAlchemy URL to'sqlite://'. - Creates an engine using the set URL and assigns it to the `engine` attribute of the imported module. - Initializes a list called `calls`. - Retrieves the built-in print function and replaces it with a mock object that saves each call made to it in the `calls` list. - Calls the main method of the imported module while passing the created mock object as the replacement for the built-in print function. - Asserts that the `calls` list contains the same values as those stored in the `expected_calls` variable.
