- Defines a fixture named `client` using pytest's built-in `fixture()` decorator with the name argument set to "client".
- The function `get_client()` is defined as the implementation of this fixture, which returns an instance of FlaskTestClient (from Flask's testing module).
- This instance represents a test client that can be used to make requests against our application and assert responses.
- We first import the necessary Flask application object from the specified tutorial file in docs_src/query_params_str_validations directory.
- Finally, we create a new TestClient instance for the imported application and return it to be used by other tests in our suite.
