- Defines a method `get_name()` that takes an argument `field`, which is of type `InstrumentedAttribute`.
- Returns either the key of the given attribute `field` or formats and returns a string using a template called `_name_format` based on the table name of the class containing the attribute and its own key. This logic ensures that nested relationships are properly named by including their parent's table name in the naming convention.
