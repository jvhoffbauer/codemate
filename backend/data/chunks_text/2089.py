- Retrieves and returns the currently authenticated user object using FastAPI's `Depends()` decorator to pass the `get_current_user()` function as a dependency for the endpoint handler. - The `read_current_user()` function takes an argument named `current_user`, which is of type `User`. This argument is automatically populated by the `get_current_user()` function, which retrieves the current user from the authentication session. - The returned value of this function is the `current_user` object itself, allowing it to be easily accessed in other parts of your application or passed along as part of subsequent requests.
