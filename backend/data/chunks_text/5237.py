- Initializes `__post_init__()`, which is called after object initialization to perform additional setup tasks. - Raises an exception (MissingAssets) with a custom error message if both 'assets' and 'expression' are missing. - Defines a dictionary ('asset_indexes') that maps asset names to lists of index positions using split(), map(), and list(). The key is extracted from the first part of the string separated by '|', while the values are obtained as integer sequences parsed from the second part separated by ','.
