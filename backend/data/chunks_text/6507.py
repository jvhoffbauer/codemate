- Defines an asynchronous method called `not_tagged_method` that takes a dictionary argument named `data`.
- The body of the function is empty, indicating it doesn't perform any operations and returns nothing (i.e., `dict()` would be returned implicitly).
- This method could potentially be used to handle requests without specific tags or labels in their data.
