- Defines a function `route` that takes in a `Request` object and an `item_id` list as arguments. The `self` parameter is assumed to be an instance of some class (not shown here). - Checks whether the user has permission to delete the specified items using the `has_delete_permission()` method. If not, returns an error response. - Deletes the specified items using the `delete_items()` method and returns a success response with the number of deleted items. Note that the `async` keyword indicates this function is asynchronous, meaning it can handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking.
