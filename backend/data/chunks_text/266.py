- Retrieves all heroes from the database whose age is less than 25 using SQLAlchemy's `Session`, `select()`, and `where()` methods. - Returns a list of matching rows, which are then accessed using `results.one()`. - Prints out the details of the first (and only in this case) selected hero to the console.
