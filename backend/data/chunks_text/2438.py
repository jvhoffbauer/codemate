- This function defines a dependency called `get_sync_context_b_raise`, which takes an optional argument `state`. The default value of this argument is obtained from another dependency, `context_b`. - If the `state` dictionary passed to this function contains keys for both 'context_a' and 'context_b', it asserts that their values are equal to specific strings ('started a' and'started b', respectively). - If any other exception (specifically, `OtherDependencyError`) is raised during the execution of this function, it raises it again.
