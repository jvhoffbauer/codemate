- Defines a fixture named `event_loop` with session scope using pytest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - Creates a new asynchronous event loop using Python's built-in `asyncio` module and its policy class, which is obtained through `asyncio.get_event_loop_policy()`. - Yields the newly created event loop to be used in tests that require an asynchronous context. - Closes the event loop after all tests have finished executing by calling the `close()` method on it.
