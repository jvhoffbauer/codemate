- Defines a function `read_items()` that takes an optional argument `q`, which is a dictionary of query parameters with default value None. The type hint for this parameter is `Dict[str, Item]`. This means that the keys in the dictionary will be strings and the values will be instances of class `Item`. - If the `q` argument is not provided (i.e., it's set to its default value), then the function body is skipped due to the `pragma: no cover` directive. This is used as a way to avoid running unnecessary code during testing or debugging.
