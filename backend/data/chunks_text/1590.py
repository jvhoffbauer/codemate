- Defines a function `get_db` that returns an instance of SQLAlchemy's session local object, which is used to manage database connections and transactions in a thread-local manner. - Uses Python's context manager (the `with` statement) with a generator expression to create a new session for each scope it's called within, allowing multiple functions or methods to access the same database connection without having to explicitly open and close it themselves. - Automatically closes the database connection when the generator exits its scope, ensuring resources are released promptly and preventing resource leaks.
