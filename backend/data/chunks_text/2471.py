- This function, `test_invalid()`, is a unit test that uses PyTest to assert an error when making a GET request for an invalid item ID (i.e., "/items/invalid"). - The `with pytest.raises(ResponseValidationError)` context manager is used to raise and catch a specific exception type, in this case `ResponseValidationError`. - If the exception is raised as expected, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.
