- Defines a GET request for `/items/`, with an optional query parameter `q`.
- Uses Pydantic's `Query` decorator to parse and validate the `q` parameter, setting it as a default value of `None` and requiring a minimum length of 3 characters.
- Returns a dictionary containing either just the list of items or also includes the search term in a new key called 'q'.
