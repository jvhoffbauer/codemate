- Tests if GET request to path "/path/param-le-ge-int/{num}" with parameter "num" equal to or less than (<=) and greater than or equal to (>=) integer value of 3 returns expected JSON response (in this case, just the number itself). - Uses Flask's built-in `client` object for making requests against our app instance. - Asserts that status code is 200 OK and expected JSON data is returned by parsing the response body using Python's built-in json module.
