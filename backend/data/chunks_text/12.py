- Defines a decorator called `Relationship` with four optional arguments: `back_populates`, `link_model`, `sa_relationship_args`, and `sa_relationship_kwargs`. - The purpose of this decorator is to create relationships between SQLAlchemy models using ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). - It allows for customization of the relationship through various parameters such as specifying which model's foreign key should be populated when querying another related model (`back_populates`) or providing additional arguments and keyword arguments to pass to SQLAlchemy's `relationship()` function (`sa_relationship_args` and `sa_relationship_kwargs`, respectively).
