- This function is a GET request for retrieving all heroes from the database using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy. - It takes two arguments `session` and `Depends`, which are used to retrieve the current database connection and pass it as an argument to other functions that need access to the database. - The `response_model` parameter specifies the expected format of the returned data (in this case, a list of Hero objects in their "read" form). - Two query parameters `offset` and `limit` are defined with default values and constraints on their range. These parameters allow paginating through large result sets without loading them all at once.
