- This function is a FastAPI route with an endpoint `/heroes/{hero_id}` and returns a Hero object in the format specified by `response_model`.
- It takes two arguments: `session`, which is obtained using the `Depends()` decorator to retrieve a database connection from the `get_session()` function, and `hero_id`, which is passed as a parameter in the URL path.
- The function retrieves the hero with the given ID from the database using SQLAlchemy's `Session.get()` method. If the hero doesn't exist, it raises a `HTTPException` with status code 404 and a custom error message. Otherwise, it simply returns the hero object.
