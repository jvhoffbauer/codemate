- Decorates a method with `@cached_property`.
- Caches the result of calling `get_permission_fields()` with "list" as an argument using Python's built-in cache decorator (`functools.cache`) to improve performance by avoiding redundant function calls.
- Returns a dictionary mapping permission field names to their corresponding labels for use in displaying permissions on lists.
