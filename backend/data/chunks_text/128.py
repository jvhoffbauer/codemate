- Defines a function called `select` with three arguments (`entity_0`, `__ent1`, and `__ent2`) that are annotated using type hints. The first argument is of type `_TScalar_0`. - Uses a type alias called `Select` to define the return type as a tuple containing `_TScalar_0`, `_T1`, and `_T2`. - Contains ellipsis (`...`) indicating that there's more implementation inside the function body but it has been omitted for brevity in this snippet.
