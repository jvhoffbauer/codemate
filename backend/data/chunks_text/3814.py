- This function tests the `GET /items/{id}/name` endpoint by making a request to it using Flask's built-in testing client (client). - The expected status code is checked against the actual one returned by the server. If they don't match, an error message containing both values is raised. - The JSON response body is also compared with what we expect for this specific item ID ("bar"). If there are any differences or unexpected keys, another error will be raised.
