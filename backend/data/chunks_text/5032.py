- Defines a function `handle_exc` that takes in a request object and an exception (`exc`) as arguments. - The function raises the same exception passed to it (`raise exc`). This is used for testing purposes or debugging scenarios where you want to intentionally raise an error instead of handling it normally. It allows developers to test how their application handles specific exceptions by simulating them during development.
