- Checks if a model field's annotation (Python type hint) is a union of types, and returns true if any of those types are `NoneType`. - Returns false otherwise, indicating that the field should not allow None values by default. This function can be used as a decorator to override the default behavior of Pydantic's `allow_reuse` feature, which allows reusing existing instances instead of creating new ones when parsing data. By setting this decorator on fields that should never accept `None`, we ensure that these fields will raise errors or validation failures instead of being set to `None`.
