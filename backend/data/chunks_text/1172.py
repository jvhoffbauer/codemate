- Defines a function `get_db` that takes an optional argument `db_state`, which is obtained using the `Depends` decorator and passed to the `reset_db_state` function (not shown here). - Inside the function, it tries to connect to the database using `database.db.connect()`. If successful, it yields control back to the caller. - In the `finally` block, it checks whether the connection has been closed or not. If not, it closes the connection before returning from the function. This ensures that the database connection is properly managed and released after use.
