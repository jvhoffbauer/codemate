- Defines a `route` function that takes three arguments: a Django Channels request object (`Request`), an ID string query parameter representing the links to associate with items (`link_id`), and a list of primary key IDs for the items being associated (`item_id`). - Checks whether the user has permission to update the linked items using the `has_update_permission` method from the `PKAdminMixin`. If no permission is granted, returns an error response. - Creates a list called `values` containing dictionaries with keys corresponding to the link and item columns defined by the model's `LinkModel` class. The dictionary values are obtained through calls to `get_python_type_parse`, which parses input strings into Python types based on their expected formats. - Uses the `map` built-in function to apply this parse operation to both the link and item lists passed as arguments. This results in two parallel lists of parsed objects. - Combines these lists into a single list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row to be inserted into the database table represented by the `LinkModel` class. - Constructs an SQL INSERT statement using the `insert` method provided by SQLAlchemy's ORM layer. - Executes the SQL statement using the `async_execute` method provided by Django Channels' PostgreSQL adapter. - Handles any exceptions thrown during execution by rolling back the transaction and returning an error response. - Returns a JSON response containing the number of rows affected by the INSERT statement, wrapped inside a `BaseApiOut` object.
