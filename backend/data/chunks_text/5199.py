- This function handles GET requests at the endpoint `/statistics` using FastAPI's decorator syntax. It returns MultiBaseStatisticsGeoJSON format, which is a GeoJSON object that can contain multiple features with their corresponding statistical values. - The function takes several dependencies including `geojson`, `src_path`, `layer_params`, `dataset_params`, `image_params`, `stats_params`, `histogram_params`, `reader_params`, and `env`. These parameters are used to extract specific information from the input file (specified by `src_path`) based on user preferences specified through these arguments. - If the input `geojson` is a single feature instead of a collection, it converts it into a collection before proceeding further. - Inside the function body, it uses RasterIO library to read the input file and apply various operations such as filtering, resampling, etc., based on the provided parameters. - For each feature in the input `geojson`, it calculates its statistical values using the `get_array_statistics()` function, passing the calculated array and other relevant parameters. - Finally, it updates the properties dictionary of the feature with the computed statistical values and returns either the first feature (if `geojson` was a single feature) or the entire collection.
