- Tests if a GET request to `/path/param-lt/{item_id}` with an item ID greater than or equal to 42 returns a HTTP status code of 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and a JSON error message containing details about the validation failure, specifically that the input should be less than 3. - The expected JSON error message includes information such as the type of validation failure ("less_than"), the location in the URL path where the validation failed ("path", "item_id"), and the context for the validation limit ("lt" and "3"). - This test uses Pytest's built-in fixtures `client` and `match_pydantic_error_url`, which are likely defined elsewhere in the project.
