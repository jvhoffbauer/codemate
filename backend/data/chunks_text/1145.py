- This function takes a `credentials` object as input, which contains the username and password provided by the user during authentication using Basic Authentication. - It first converts the username to bytes using UTF-8 encoding. - The hardcoded correct username and password are compared with the actual values using the `secrets.compare_digest()` method from the `secrets` module in Python's standard library. - If either the username or password is incorrect, an HTTPException with status code 401 Unauthorized is raised along with a WWW-Authenticate header containing the value 'Basic'. - Otherwise, the function returns the authenticated username.
