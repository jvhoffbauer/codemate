- This function `get_current_user()` takes a dependency of an OAuth2 access token (`Annotated[str, Depends(oauth2_scheme)]`) and returns the current authenticated user based on that token. - If the token cannot be validated or decoded using the secret key and algorithm specified in the `jwt.decode()` method, it raises a customized HTTPException with a specific error message and WWW-Authenticate header for Bearer tokens. - The function extracts the sub claim from the decoded payload to obtain the username, which is then used to retrieve the corresponding user object from a fake database (`get_user()`). - If the user object is not found, another HTTPException is raised.
