- Generates a dictionary of headers containing an authentication token for the superuser (admin) during module-level tests using PyTest and Flask's built-in test client.
- Uses the `user_authentication_headers()` helper function to generate the necessary headers based on the provided email and password credentials.
- Scope is set to "module" to ensure that the fixture is reused across all tests in the current Python file.
