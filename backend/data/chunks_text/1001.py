- This function takes a dictionary `type_encoder_map`, which maps types to their corresponding encoders. - It returns another dictionary called `encoders_by_class_tuples`. The keys of this dictionary are the encoders themselves, and the values are tuples containing all the classes that can be encoded by each encoder. - By using a `defaultdict` with an initial value of `tuple()`, we avoid having to check if the key already exists in the dictionary before adding its class to the tuple.
