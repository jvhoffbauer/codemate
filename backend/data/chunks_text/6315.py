- Defines an `async` function called `get_session` that returns a generator of type `AsyncGenerator`.
- Inside the function, creates an instance of `async_session()`, which is assumed to be an asynchronous database connection manager.
- Yields the created session object for use in other parts of the program using generators.
- The `None` return value indicates that this function doesn't return any values directly but instead yields objects through its generator.
