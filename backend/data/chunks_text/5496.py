- Tests the `GET /mosaicjson/bounds` endpoint using Flask's built-in testing client (`app`) and passing in a URL parameter for the mosaic JSON file to use. - Asserts that the HTTP status code is 200, indicating success. - Parses the JSON response into a dictionary called `body`. - Verifies that there are exactly four bounding box coordinates returned by the API. - Confirms that the first and third coordinates of the bounds are not equal or less than each other, ensuring they form a valid rectangle. - Checks that the second and fourth coordinates also follow this pattern.
