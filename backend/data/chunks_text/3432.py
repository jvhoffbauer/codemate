- Tests if passing a non-integer value for path parameter 'item_id' raises a validation error with status code 422 and appropriate error message in JSON response body. - Uses `IsDict` from `asgiref.typedefs` library to check that the expected structure of the error message is returned by Flask-Pydantic. - Includes both current (Python 3.9+) and legacy (Python < 3.9) formats of error messages due to backward compatibility requirements.
