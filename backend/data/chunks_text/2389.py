- Defines a computed property named `area` for the current class (presumably representing a rectangle).
- The value of this property is calculated using the values of two other properties, `width` and `length`, both of which are assumed to be integers.
- This implementation follows Python's data descriptor protocol, as indicated by the presence of both `@property` and `@computed_field`.
