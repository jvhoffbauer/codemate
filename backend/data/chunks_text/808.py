- This function takes a `JWTData` object as an argument, which is obtained from the `parse_jwt_user_data` dependency. - It checks whether the user with this JWT has administrative privileges by accessing the `is_admin` attribute of the `token`. - If the user doesn't have admin rights, it raises an `AuthorizationFailed` exception to indicate that they are not authorized for this operation. - Otherwise, it returns the original `JWTData` object unchanged.
