- This test uses `pytest` and `FastAPI` to test a specific endpoint (`POST /files`) that accepts multiple files and a token in the request body. - The test creates two temporary files containing some text, then sends them along with their respective names and contents using the `TestClient` class provided by `FastAPI`. - The server returns a JSON response containing information about both uploaded files, including their sizes and MIME types if available.
