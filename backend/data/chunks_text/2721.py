- Defines a GET endpoint with the path `/response_model_union-no_annotation-return_Model2`.
- Specifies that the endpoint returns an object of type Union[User, Item]. This means it can return either a User or an Item object.
- The function itself simply creates and returns an Item object with some values. Since we're returning an Item object, this satisfies the response model specified in the decorator.
