- Defines an asynchronous function `depend` that takes two arguments: a list of IDs for items to be dependent on (`ItemIdListDepend`) and a SQLAlchemy select object representing the query to retrieve dependent items (`AnnotatedSelect`). - Converts the input list of IDs into a list of Python types using `get_python_type_parse`. This is likely used to ensure consistency in how IDs are handled throughout the application. - Retrieves the set of dependent items from the database using the provided SQLAlchemy select object with a WHERE clause filtering by the primary key being in the list of input IDs. The results are returned as a list of tuples containing only the primary keys. - Returns all the primary keys retrieved from the database.
