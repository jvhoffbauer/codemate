- Defines a function called `select` with three arguments (`__ent0`, `entity_1`, and `__ent2`) that are annotated as specific types using PyCharm's type hinting feature. The first argument is of type `List[Any]`, which can be any data structure in Python. - Returns a new object called `Select` that combines two lists based on a condition specified by the second list (`entity_1`). This operation is commonly used to filter or extract specific elements from larger datasets. - The returned object has a generic type `Select[Tuple[_T0, _TScalar_1, _T2]]`. This means it contains tuples consisting of elements selected from both input lists, along with the scalar value provided by the second list.
