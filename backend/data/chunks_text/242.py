- This function is a GET request for reading all teams using FastAPI's `@app.get` decorator. - The `response_model` parameter specifies that the response will be in the format of a list of Team objects (defined elsewhere) as specified by Pydantic's `BaseModel`. - Two query parameters are defined using FastAPI's `Query` class: `offset`, which defaults to zero and limits the number of results returned; and `limit`, which has a default value of 100 and ensures it doesn't exceed 100. - The SQLAlchemy `Session` object is retrieved from the `get_session` dependency function, and then used with the `exec` method to execute a SELECT statement on the `Team` model, passing in the `offset` and `limit` values. - Finally, the resulting list of `Team` objects is returned as the API response.
