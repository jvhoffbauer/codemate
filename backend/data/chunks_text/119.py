- This function is an overloaded version of `select`, which takes three iterables as arguments (`__ent0`, `__ent1`, and `__ent2`) with types `_TCCA[_T0]`, `_TCCA[_T1]`, and `_TCCA[_T2]`, respectively. - The return type of this function is a tuple containing all possible combinations of elements from the input iterables, represented by the `Select` generic alias. - The implementation details are omitted for brevity (represented by ellipses).
