- This function prints out a list of environment variables and their values for each defined environment (stored in `environments`) using the `print()` method. - It creates an empty list called `env_lines`, which will hold strings representing each environment's variable assignments. - For each environment in `environments`, it initializes an empty list called `env_vars`. - Inside this loop, it iterates over all items (i.e., key-value pairs) in the current environment dictionary, appends each pair to `env_vars` as a string with quotes around the value, and joins them together into a single space-separated string that represents the entire set of variables for that environment. - Finally, it adds this string to `env_lines` and continues iterating through the remaining environments until all have been processed. - After processing all environments, it loops back through `env_lines` and uses `print()` to output each individual environment's variable assignment string on its own line.
