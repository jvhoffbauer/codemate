- Defines a GET request for an item with ID `item_id`.
- Returns the requested item from the dictionary `items`, which is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the application.
- Uses Pydantic's `response_model` decorator to specify that the function should return an object of type `Item`, as defined by another part of the application (also likely outside this snippet).
