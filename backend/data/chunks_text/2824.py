- This test checks if a `RuntimeError` is raised when trying to create an instance of `FastAPI` and registering a route that uses the `Form` parameter decorator from Pydantic's `fastapi` plugin, but without multipart support being installed (i.e., `multipart` package not found). - The error message should be the one defined in `multipart_incorrect_install_error`. - To simulate this scenario, we use Python's built-in `unittest.mock` module (specifically its `MonkeyPatch` class) to temporarily remove the `parse_options_header` method from the `multipart.Multipart` base class, which raises an exception when called without multipart support being installed.
