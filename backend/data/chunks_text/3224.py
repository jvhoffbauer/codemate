- Tests the security of API key authentication by making a request to `/users/me` with an authorized key (`"secret"`) and verifying that the expected user data is returned as JSON in the response body. - Uses Flask's built-in testing client to simulate HTTP requests without actually sending them over the network. - Asserts that the status code of the response is 200 OK and checks the contents of the response text and JSON payload for correctness.
