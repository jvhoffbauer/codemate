- Tests if passing an integer less than or equal to 3 as a path parameter for `/path/param-gt-int/{item_id}` results in a HTTP status code of 422 and an error message containing details about the validation failure, specifically that the input should be greater than 3 (with gt=3). - The error message conforms to JSON API specification's schema for errors with a single item array under detail key. - This implementation follows PEP8 style guide recommendations.
