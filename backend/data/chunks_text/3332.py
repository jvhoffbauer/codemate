- Defines a GET request for a path with a hidden parameter called `hidden_path`.
- Uses FastAPI's `Path` decorator to parse and validate the `hidden_path` argument, but sets its `include_in_schema` flag to False to exclude it from API documentation and requests.
- Returns an HTTP response containing the value of the `hidden_path` parameter as part of a dictionary.
