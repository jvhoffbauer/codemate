- Defines a function called `select` with three arguments (`entity_0`, `__ent1`, and `entity_2`) of types `_TScalar_0`, `_TCCA[_T1]`, and `_TScalar_2`, respectively. The first argument is annotated with a type hint that's ignored by mypy for some reason. - Returns a new object of type `Select[Tuple[_TScalar_0, _T1, _TScalar_2]]`. This suggests that this version of `select` is used to extract specific elements from tuples where the selected elements have scalar types (_TScalar_0), are contained in arrays of type `_TCCA[_T1]`, and have scalar types again (_TScalar_2). Note that the second argument has a strange name ("__ent1") which might be related to PyCharm's naming conventions or internal implementation details.
