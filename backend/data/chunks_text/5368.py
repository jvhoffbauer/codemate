- Sets environment variable `GDAL_DISABLE_READDIR_ON_OPEN` to a custom value using `monkeypatch`.
- Creates an instance of FastAPI and defines multiple endpoints that use GDAL configuration settings.
- Tests each endpoint separately using PyTest's built-in testing framework (client).
- Confirms that synchronous requests always override the environment variable set by `monkeypatch`, while asynchronous requests respect it.
