- Initializes a dictionary called `asset_indexes` with keys as asset names and values as lists of index positions (converted from strings). This is done after object initialization to ensure that `asset_indexes` can be accessed by other methods or attributes within the class. - The dictionary creation uses list comprehension to iterate over each element in `self.asset_indexes`, split it into an asset name and comma-separated index positions, convert those positions to integers using map(), and store them in the new dictionary. - Type hinting is used to specify the expected types of the resulting dictionary and its key/value pairs.
