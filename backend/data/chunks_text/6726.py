- Defines a function `check_string_keys` that takes a dictionary (`map`) as an argument.
- Iterates over all keys and values of the input dictionary using a dictionary comprehension syntax.
- Asserts that each key is an instance of string type using Python's built-in `assert` statement.
- Recursively calls itself with the nested dictionaries found inside any dictionary values encountered during iteration.
