- Defines a new endpoint `/example_examples/` using FastAPI's decorator syntax
- Accepts an argument named `item`, which is bound to the request body parsed by Pydantic's `Body()` function
- The `Item` class, defined elsewhere in the application, has two fields: `example` and `examples`. Both are optional (defaulting to None) and can be omitted from the request body if not needed. - In this specific usage, we pass a dictionary with a single key-value pair ("data", "Overridden example") as the value for the `example` field, and a list of dictionaries containing another "data" key-value pair each as values for the `examples` field. This allows us to provide both a default example and additional examples that can be customized per request. - Finally, the method returns the `item` object passed into it, effectively passing back whatever was provided via the request body.
