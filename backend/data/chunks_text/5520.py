- Mocks `requests.get()` and `rasterio.open()` functions using Python's built-in unittest.mock module to simulate their behavior during testing. - Tests the `GET /stac/preview` endpoint by passing a URL for an STAC item (`https://myurl.com/item.json`) with specific asset requests (`B1111`, `rescale=[0, 1000]`, and `max_size=64`) as query parameters. - Asserts that the expected HTTP status code of 404 is returned when the requested assets are not found in the provided STAC item.
