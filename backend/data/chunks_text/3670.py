- Tests sending a `PUT` request to update an item with no header containing an authorization token (i.e., missing 'X-Token' header). - Asserts that the server returns a HTTP status code of 422 Unprocessable Entity and includes a JSON error message in the body. - The error message contains two errors, one for each location where the authorization token is expected ('query' parameter and 'X-Token' header), indicating that both are required.
