- Tests different query parameters for `/User/list` endpoint using FastAPI's built-in SQLAlchemy ORM and Pydantic models to filter, sort, paginate, search, and fuzzy match data from a database table named 'user'. - Uses `fake_users` fixture provided by pytest-mock to simulate user records in the database without actually persisting them. - Verifies correctness of response body structure and content based on expected results.
