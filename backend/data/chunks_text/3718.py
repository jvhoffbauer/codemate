- Creates a new SQLite database at `./sql_app.db` for testing purposes, deletes any existing file with the same name (skips this step in coverage mode). - Imports and initializes the Flask app defined in `docs_src/sql_databases/sql_app.py`, which creates the necessary tables in the newly created database during startup. - Reloads the imported module to ensure that all import side effects are executed again before each test case is run. - Yields a TestClient object representing an HTTP request context manager, allowing tests to interact with the application's endpoints using requests and assertions. - Deletes the temporary database file after the test suite completes execution.
