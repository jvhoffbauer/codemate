- Defines a function `get_path_param_gt` that takes an optional argument `item_id`, which is assigned a default value of a path object with a query parameter `gt` set to 3. - The `Path()` constructor creates a new relative or absolute file system path, and in this case, it's being used as a way to pass a URL query string parameter (`gt`) into our function. - The returned value from the function is the `item_id` variable, which can be any type since we didn't specify its data type explicitly. However, by using the `Path()` constructor, we ensure that the input `item_id` will always have a valid format for passing as a URL query parameter.
