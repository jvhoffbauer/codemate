- This function is a decorator that validates admin access for protected endpoints using FastAPI's dependency injection system. - It takes a `JWTData` object as an argument, which represents the decoded payload of a JSON Web Token (JWT). - If the user has an administrative role (stored in the `is_admin` field of the JWT data), the function returns without raising any errors. Otherwise, it raises a custom exception called `AuthorizationFailed`.
