- Defines a new class `BandsExprParamsOptional`, which is a subclass of both `ExpressionParams` and `BandsParams`. - This allows for optional band names and expression parameters to be passed in as arguments when creating an instance of this class. - The `pass` statement here means that no additional attributes or methods are being defined for this class at this time; it simply inherits from its parent classes.
