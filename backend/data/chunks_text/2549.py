- Tests the `Router` middleware's handling of URL parameters and query strings in WebSocket connections using Flask's built-in testing client (TestClient). - Connects to a specific WebSocket endpoint ("/router/path/to/file") with custom query string parameters ("queryparam=a_query_param"). - Verifies that the received messages contain both the path component ("path/to/file") and the query parameter value ("a_query_param"), which were passed through correctly by the router middleware.
