- This function is a pytest fixture that uses `@needs_py39` to ensure Python version 3.9 or higher is required for running tests. - It defines two parameters, `url` and `data`, with three different values using the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator. - The function takes an instance of Flask's built-in testing client as its argument, which allows us to make requests against our app without starting it up separately. - For each value in the parameter list, we call the `client.get()` method passing the URL from the first parameter and store the result in a variable called `response`. - We then check if the status code returned by the server is equal to 200, and if not, print out the error message along with the contents of the response body. If the status code is correct, we compare the JSON representation of the response object with the second parameter passed into the function.
