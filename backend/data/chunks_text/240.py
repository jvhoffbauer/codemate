- This function creates a new team using FastAPI's `@app.post` decorator and returns its details in JSON format (specified by `response_model`) after committing it to the database via SQLAlchemy's `Session`. - The `*` before `session` is used for keyword-only arguments, allowing us to pass multiple dependencies at once without specifying their names explicitly. Here we are passing both `session` and `team`, which will be automatically unpacked into separate parameters inside the function body. - The `Depends` function from FastAPI is used here to retrieve an instance of our `SessionLocal` class that manages connections with the database. We can then use this connection to interact with our models as needed.
