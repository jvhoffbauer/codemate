- Defines an asynchronous function called `update_item` that takes two arguments: `item_id` and `item`. The `item` argument is passed to the function using the `Body()` decorator from Pydantic's FastAPI plugin. - Inside the function, a dictionary called `results` is created with keys for both `item_id` and `item`, which are assigned their respective values. - Finally, the `results` dictionary is returned by the function. This function can be used in conjunction with FastAPI to easily pass complex data structures between endpoints without having to manually parse JSON or other formats.
