- Defines a function `all_` that takes an argument of either a column expression or any value (`Union`) and returns a collection aggregate object representing the SQL `ALL` operator using SQLAlchemy's built-in `sqlalchemy.all_()`. - The `CollectionAggregate` class is used to represent aggregates over collections, such as arrays or lists, in SQL queries. In this case, it's being returned by our custom `all_()` function instead of the default one provided by SQLAlchemy. This allows us to use our own implementation of the ALL operator with more flexibility than what's available out of the box. Note that we also have to suppress a type hinting warning for the second argument due to its dynamic nature.
