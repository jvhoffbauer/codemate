- Initializes a function called `index` that takes in a parameter named `websocket`. This parameter is of type `WebSocket`, which represents an open connection between the server and client. - Calls the `await` keyword to wait for the `accept()` method to complete before continuing with the rest of the function. The `accept()` method returns a coroutine object that resolves when the handshake process completes successfully. - Sends a text message "Hello, world!" using the `send_text()` method provided by PureAsyncio's built-in `WebSocket` class. - Closes the web socket connection using the `close()` method provided by PureAsyncio's built-in `WebSocket` class.
