- Defines two routes with similar signatures that both call the `map_viewer()` function. The first route matches requests to `/map`, while the second one matches requests to URLs starting with `/{TileMatrixSetId}/map`. - Accepts several query parameters and dependencies, including `src_path`, `TileMatrixSetId`, `tile_format`, `tile_scale`, `minzoom`, `maxzoom`, `buffer`, `post_process`, `rescale`, `color_formula`, `colormap`, `renderer_params`, `reader_params`, and `env`. These arguments are used to customize various aspects of the generated tiles, such as their format, resolution, buffering, processing, scaling, colorization, rendering, and reading options. - Returns an HTML template named `index.html` using FastAPI's built-in templating engine. This template contains dynamic content based on the input parameters, such as the requested URL, supported TMS, resolutions, and other metadata.
