- Initializes a database connection using SQLAlchemy's `AsyncEngine`.
- Drops all existing tables from the database using `DropAll()` method of `Metadata`.
- Creates new tables in the database using `CreateAll()` method of `Metadata`.
- Yields control to the caller (i.e., returns without executing any further statements).
- Finally drops all tables again before returning from the function. This is done for cleanup purposes and ensures that the database remains empty after the script has finished running.
