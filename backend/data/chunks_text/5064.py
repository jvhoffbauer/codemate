- Defines a new method `op` for the current class (presumably a subclass of `Request`) that takes three arguments: `url`, an optional JSON payload (`json`), and any additional keyword arguments (`**kwargs`) passed to the parent's `super().post()` call. - Returns a `Response` object containing the response body as JSON after making a POST request using the `super().post()` method with the given URL, headers, and parameters. If the response contains a key named 'item', this value is returned instead. Otherwise, the entire response dictionary is returned.
