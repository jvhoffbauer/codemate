- This function tests the `tutorial001_py310` module in the `docs_src/tutorial` directory using pytest's `clear_sqlmodel` fixture to clear SQLModel's metadata before each test case. - The `import` statement imports the specific module being tested, which is named `tutorial001_py310`. - The `create_engine` function from SQLAlchemy is called to create a connection to an SQLite database at the specified URL. - A mock object for Python's built-in `print` function is created and stored in a variable named `new_print`, along with a list of expected print statements (stored in `expected_calls`) that should be executed during the test. - The `patch` decorator from Pytest-Mock is used to replace the original `print` function with our custom mock object. - Finally, the main function of the module under test is invoked within this patched context, allowing us to capture any output printed by the module and verify it matches our expectations.
