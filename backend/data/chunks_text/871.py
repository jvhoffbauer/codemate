1. Defines a function `create_cloned_field` that takes a model field as input and returns a new clone of it with some modifications.
2. If the original type of the field is a dataclass with a `__pydantic_model__` attribute (which indicates that it's been previously processed), then its corresponding clone will be retrieved from a cache called `cloned_types`. Otherwise, a new clone will be created using `create_model`, which creates a new class based on an existing one. The cache helps avoid redundant cloning when dealing with nested or cyclic data structures.
3. For each field inside the original dataclass, a new clone will also be generated recursively until all fields have been replaced. This ensures that the entire structure is properly cloned without losing any information.
