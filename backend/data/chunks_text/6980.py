- This function is a pytest mark with asyncio scope for testing asynchronous functions. - It takes an `AsyncSession` object from the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension as its parameter and uses it to make HTTP requests using the `aiohttp` library's `ClientSession`. - The function creates a dictionary called `login_data`, which contains the email address of the first user (defined in `settings.py`) and their password (retrieved securely from AWS Secrets Manager). - It sends a POST request to the "/api/v1/login/" endpoint with this data, expecting a response status code of 200 OK. - If the response status code is correct, it checks that the JSON body contains expected keys ("token_type" and "access_token").
