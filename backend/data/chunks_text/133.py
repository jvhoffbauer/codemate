- Defines an overloaded function called `select` with three positional arguments of generic types `_TScalar_0`, `_TScalar_1`, and `_TScalar_2`. The `type: ignore` annotation is used to suppress a mypy warning about unused variables in this context. - Returns a new instance of the `Select` class that represents a tuple containing all three selected entities as its elements. This implementation assumes that each argument passed to the function corresponds to a specific scalar value or entity within some larger data structure or model. By returning a tuple of these values, we can easily extract them for further processing or analysis without having to manually concatenate or join them together. Note that the use of underscores (`_`) before the parameter names indicates that they are not being explicitly referenced in this particular function signature; instead, their types are being used implicitly by the return type annotation.
