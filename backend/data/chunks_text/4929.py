- This function tests creating a new user by a normal (non-admin) user using their authentication token as an authorization header. - It uses `get_server_api()` to retrieve the base URL of the API and generates random strings for the username and password. - The request is made with `requests.post()`, passing in the generated URL, headers containing the normal user's auth token, and JSON data representing the new user's details. - If successful, the response status should be 201 CREATED; otherwise, it should return a 400 BAD REQUEST error.
