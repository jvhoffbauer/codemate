- Overrides `common_parameters` dependency with a custom implementation that returns a dictionary for testing purposes in the context of router decorators and dependencies. - Makes an HTTP GET request to the decorated route with a missing query parameter 'k'. - Asserts that the status code is 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and the JSON response contains a validation error indicating that the 'k' parameter is required. - Resets the dependency override at the end of the test case.
