- Tests that sending a POST request to `/files/` without a body raises a 422 Unprocessable Entity error with an appropriate JSON response containing a detail field with a missing key error message for the 'file' parameter. - The JSON response is validated using Pytest-mock's mock object `match_pydantic_error_url` and the `IsDict` type hint from more-itertools library to ensure it matches the expected format of the error message returned by Pydantic's validation process.
