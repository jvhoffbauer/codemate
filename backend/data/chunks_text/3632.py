- This function is a unit test called `test_dummy_webhook`. It's used to ensure that our webhook handling logic is covered by tests, even if it doesn't actually perform any meaningful actions in this case (hence "dummy"). - The `new_subscription()` method is being called with an empty request body and a dummy authentication token ("Bearer 123"). - Since we don't have any other context or details about how `new_subscription()` works, there isn't much else to say here!
