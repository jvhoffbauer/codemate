- This function tests a specific tutorial in SQLAlchemy's documentation using pytest and the `clearsqlmodel` fixture to clear any existing data before running each test case. - It imports the necessary classes for the tutorial (app and database) and sets up their configurations. - It creates a mock object called `new_print` that replaces the built-in print function during testing, allowing us to capture its output as part of our assertions. - The main application is started within a context manager that patches the built-in print function with the mock object created earlier. - Finally, we check if the captured outputs match what was expected based on the behavior described in the tutorial.
