- Imports `tutorial004_py310` module from the documentation sources and runs its main function, capturing print statements for testing purposes using a custom printing function provided by Pytest. - Sets up an SQLAlchemy engine connected to a local SQLite database at the given URL. - Defines a list called 'calls' that will store captured print statements during execution of the `main()` method in the imported module. - Patches the built-in Python `print()` function with a custom implementation that adds each printed statement to the 'calls' list instead of actually displaying it on the console. This allows us to verify that the correct output is generated without interfering with normal program behavior or polluting the console output.
