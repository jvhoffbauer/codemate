- This function retrieves a list of users using FastAPI's dependency injection to retrieve an active superuser and the default database connection from SQLAlchemy. - The `skip` and `limit` query parameters are used to paginate through the results. - The resulting list is returned as JSON with the `response_model` decorator.
