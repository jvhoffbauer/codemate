- This is a unit test for the `tutorial004` module in the SQLModel tutorial section of the documentation. - It uses the `pytest-mock` plugin to mock out the built-in print function and capture its output. - The `create_engine` function from SQLAlchemy's engine factory is called to create an engine instance that will be used by the tested module. - The captured output is compared against expected results using pytest's assertions.
