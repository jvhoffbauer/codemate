- Defines a function `set_site()` that takes three arguments: `site`, an instance of Django's built-in `AdminSite` class; `alias`, an optional string to use as an alternative name for the site (default is 'admin'); and `overwrite`, a boolean flag indicating whether to replace any existing site with this new one or not (default is false). - The function returns the result of calling another helper function called `set_global()`. This function is not defined in this snippet but it seems to be responsible for storing the value of `site` somewhere globally, possibly in a configuration file or database. - By returning the result of `set_global()`, `set_site()` allows callers to easily check if the operation was successful or not without having to make additional API calls.
