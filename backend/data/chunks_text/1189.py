- This function takes an email string as input and returns a User object from the database using Django's built-in filtering functionality. - The `==` operator is used to compare the value of the 'email' field in the User model with the provided email parameter. - The `first()` method is called on the resulting QuerySet to retrieve the first (and hopefully unique) matching record, or None if no matches are found.
