- Initializes a `Form` object with default values and sets its API endpoint to POST requests on the specified path. - If an initialization API is required, it creates one for GET requests at the same path. - Sets the initial title of the form to empty string. - Retrieves available actions using `get_actions()`, which are displayed as buttons below the form. - Fetches all fields from the schema's model and generates corresponding form items using `get_form_item()`. - Appends each generated item to the body of the `Form` object.
