- This method is annotated with `@DynamicClassAttribute`, which allows it to be called as a class attribute instead of an instance method. - It returns a dictionary from the `img_profiles` global variable, where the key is the name of the current object (stored in `self._name_)`. - If the key doesn't exist, an empty dictionary is returned. The purpose of this method seems to be providing a default image profile based on the type of object being used.
