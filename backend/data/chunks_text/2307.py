- Generates an OpenAPI v3.1.0 schema for a FastAPI application using the `client` object to make a GET request to the `/openapi.json` endpoint. - Asserts that the status code is 200 and checks the text of the response if necessary. - Verifies that the JSON returned by the API matches the expected structure with specific keys such as 'openapi', 'info', 'paths', 'components'. - Extracts relevant information from the generated schema, including endpoints (e.g., '/items/' in this case), HTTP methods ('GET' here), responses ('200'), summary descriptions ('Read Items'), operation IDs ('read_items_items__get'), and security schemes ('OAuth2PasswordBearer').
