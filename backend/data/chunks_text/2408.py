- This endpoint uses a dependency function `asyncgen_state_try` that returns an asynchronous generator to set the initial value of the `state` parameter. - The `get_async_raise` handler raises an `AsyncDependencyError`, which is handled by FastAPI's error handling mechanism. - The test case for this endpoint checks if the `state` variable has the expected value before raising the exception, demonstrating how dependencies can be used in conjunction with generators and exceptions.
