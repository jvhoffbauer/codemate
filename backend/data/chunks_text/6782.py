- Defines a new method `update()` for updating user records in the database using SQLAlchemy's session object (`Session`) and passing two arguments - the current user record to be updated from the database (`db_obj`) and an input dictionary or Pydantic model containing the updates (`obj_in`).
- Checks whether the input is a dictionary or a Pydantic model instance. If it's a dictionary, assigns it directly to the `update_data` variable; otherwise, converts it into a dictionary with excluded unset fields using Pydantic's `dict()` function.
- If the password field is present in the input data, generates a hash of the password using the `get_password_hash()` helper function defined elsewhere, deletes the original password field from the input data, and adds the hashed password as a new key called "hashed_password" in the input dictionary. This ensures that plaintext passwords are never stored in the database but instead replaced by their hashes.
- Calls the parent class's `update()` method with the same parameters passed down, effectively executing the actual database update operation.
