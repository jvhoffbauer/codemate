- Defines a method `__getitem__()` for dictionary-like access to Redis keys using string names as indices. - Delegates the key lookup operation to an instance variable `_redis_client`, which is assumed to be a Redis client object with appropriate methods for retrieving values by key. - Returns the value associated with the specified key from the Redis server and returns it to the caller of this method.
