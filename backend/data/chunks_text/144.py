- Defines a function called `select` with four arguments (`__ent0`, `entity_1`, `__ent2`, and `__ent3`) that are annotated as specific types using PyCharm's type hinting feature. The first argument is ignored for some reason. - Returns an object of type `Select` which represents a selection operation on multiple entities based on a scalar value provided by `entity_1`. - This implementation follows the functional programming paradigm where functions take inputs and return outputs without modifying any external state or variables.
