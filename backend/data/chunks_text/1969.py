- This function creates a new note and inserts it into the `notes` table of a SQLite database using FastAPI's built-in ORM (Object Relational Mapping).
- The request body is parsed as an instance of the `NoteIn` model defined elsewhere in the application.
- The inserted record's ID is retrieved from the result set returned by executing the INSERT statement, which is then included in the response payload along with the rest of the requested data.
