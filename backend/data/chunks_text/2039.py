- This function takes a list of page, section, or link objects as input and returns a modified version with renamed sections based on configuration settings. - It recursively processes each section's child pages/sections to find the first index file (i.e., "index.md") and uses its title to rename the parent section unless otherwise specified. - The original section object is updated instead of creating a new one to preserve collapsible behavior.
