- Defines a private method `_create_schema_create` that creates a Schema object representing the create operation for this API endpoint's resource. - Sets the default value of `create_fields` to be equal to the `insfields` attribute of the underlying Django model class, unless explicitly overridden by the user. - Filters out excluded fields and non-model fields from the `create_fields` list before creating the final Schema object.
