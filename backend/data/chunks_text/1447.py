- Defines an asynchronous function `read_main` that takes two arguments: `item_id` and (optionally) a header named 'X-Token' with default value of `Header()`. - Checks whether the 'X-Token' header is equal to a predefined secret token ('fake_secret_token'). If it isn't, raises a `HTTPException` with status code 400 and error message "Invalid X-Token header". - Checks whether the requested `item_id` exists in a dictionary called `fake_db`. If it doesn't exist, raises another `HTTPException` with status code 404 and error message "Item not found". - Returns the corresponding value from `fake_db` for the given `item_id`, assuming it was successfully checked against both conditions above.
