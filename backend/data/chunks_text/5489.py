- Tests the `/info`, `/info.geojson`, and `/point` endpoints for a COG with NaNs using patch decorator to replace rasterio's open function. - Verifies that the correct data type (float32), nodata type ("Nodata"), and value (None) are returned in JSON format from the `/info` endpoint. - Confirms that the geometry, nodata type ("Nodata"), and value (None) are correctly included in GeoJSON format from the `/info.geojson` endpoint. - Checks that the value at a specific point (79.80860440702253,21.852217086223234) returns the expected NaN value when accessed through the `/point` endpoint.
