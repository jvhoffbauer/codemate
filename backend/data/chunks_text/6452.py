- Defines an asynchronous function called `endpoint` that takes a request object named `__request__` as its argument. - The `del` statement is used to delete (i.e., unbind) the name binding for the variable `__request__`. This has no effect on the actual request object, but it's a way of signaling that this parameter isn't being used in the function body and can be safely omitted from future calls to the function. - Since Python doesn't support overloading functions based on their arguments, using `del` statements like this can help clarify which parameters are required versus optional or ignored by the function.
