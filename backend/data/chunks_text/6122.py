- This function listens to the `after_delete` event of SQLAlchemy's User model using the `@event.listens_for()` decorator. - The function takes three arguments: mapper (the mapping object), connection (the database connection), and target (the deleted user instance). - Inside the function, we check if the target is indeed an instance of our custom User class using the `isinstance()` method. - If so, we increment a global counter called `event_counter.after`.
