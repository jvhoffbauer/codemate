- Defines a fixture named `client` that is used in pytests to create and manage test clients for interacting with an instance of the FastAPI application (`app`) during tests. - The fixture takes two arguments: `app`, which is the FastAPI app being tested, and `prepare_database`, which is any necessary database preparation before running tests. - Uses the context manager syntax to wrap the creation of the test client within a generator function, allowing it to be yielded back to the caller for use in other fixtures or tests.
