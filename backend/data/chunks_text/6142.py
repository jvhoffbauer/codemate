- Defines a `SqlalchemyCrud` object for the `Article` model and registers it as a CRUD endpoint under the prefix `/article`. - Includes the registered crud endpoints into the main FastAPI application. - Asserts that the schema read property of the crud instance is none since we haven't defined any explicit schema yet. - Raises an exception when trying to access the non-existent'read' route using url_path_for(). - Tests the OpenAPI documentation generated by FastAPI to ensure that the correct routes are included (list, item), and checks if the expected HTTP methods are present on each route.
