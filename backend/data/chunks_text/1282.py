- This function is a FastAPI endpoint with an `@app.post` decorator and a route of `"/uploadfile/"`.
- It accepts a single argument named `file`, which is annotated using Pydantic's `Annotated` class to specify that it should be treated as both a parameter (`file`) and a field in a request body schema (`UploadFile`). The `File` annotation from FastAPI provides additional metadata about the uploaded file, such as its size and content type.
- Inside the function, we simply return a dictionary containing the filename of the uploaded file, which can then be used for further processing or storage.
