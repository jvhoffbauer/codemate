- Defines a class method `valid_url_` that takes a URL string as an argument (`url`) and returns it with a trailing slash added or removed based on its current state. - The method checks whether the URL ends with a forward slash ("/"). If so, it removes the last character using slicing syntax (`[-1]`) to remove the trailing "/". Otherwise, it simply returns the original URL unchanged. - This method is useful for ensuring consistent formatting of URLs in various contexts where trailing slashes may be optional or preferred, such as when generating links or performing redirects.
