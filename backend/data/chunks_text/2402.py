- Defines an asynchronous function `context_a` that takes a dictionary argument `state`, which is dependent on the `get_state()` function from the `fastapi.Depends` decorator. - Sets the value of the key 'context_a' in the `state` dictionary to'started a'. - Uses the `yield` statement to pass control back to the caller, while also preserving the current state for later use by other coroutines or functions. - In the `finally` block, sets the value of the key 'context_a' in the `state` dictionary to 'finished a', regardless of whether an exception was raised inside the `try` block.
