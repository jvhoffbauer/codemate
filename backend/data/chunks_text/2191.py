- Initializes a dictionary `counter_holder` to hold the value of the global counter and sets it to zero. - Makes an HTTP GET request to the URL "/sub-counter/" using Flask's built-in testing client (client). - Asserts that the status code returned by the server is 200 OK and saves any error messages in the `response.text`. - Retrieves the JSON data from the server's response body and asserts that the key 'counter' has a value of 1 and the subkey'subcounter' also has a value of 1. - Repeats steps 2-4 for another HTTP GET request to verify that the values have incremented correctly.
