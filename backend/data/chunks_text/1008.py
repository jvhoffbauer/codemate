- This function is an asynchronous method called when a request is made to the server. - It retrieves the API key from the request headers using the `Request.headers` dictionary and the name of the model (presumably stored in a class attribute). - If no API key is found, it checks whether the `auto_error` flag is set. If so, it raises a HTTP exception with a forbidden status code and a message indicating that authentication failed. Otherwise, it returns `None`.
