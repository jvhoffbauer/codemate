- Defines a function `gen_jwt` that takes in two arguments `subject` and `minutes`.
- The `subject` argument can be either a string or any other type (using Python's `Union`).
- Inside the function, an expiration time is calculated based on the current time plus the number of minutes specified by `minutes`.
- A dictionary containing the subject and expiration time is created and passed as input to the `jwt.encode` method along with the secret key and algorithm.
- The resulting JWT token is returned from the function.
