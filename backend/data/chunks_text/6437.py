- Defines a cached property called `request` that returns an instance of `JsonRpcRequest`. - Uses Python's built-in `@cached_property` decorator to cache the result of this function call for future requests with the same arguments (i.e., `self.raw_request`). - First attempts to validate the raw JSON RPC request using the `model_validate()` method provided by the `request_class`, which is likely a subclass of `JsonRPCRequest`. - If validation fails, raises an exception derived from `InvalidRequestFromValidationError` instead.
