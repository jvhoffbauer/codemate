- Defines a middleware function called `db_session_middleware` that takes in a `Request` object and a callback function (`call_next`) as arguments. - Creates a new session using `SessionLocal()` and sets it to the `request.state.db` attribute. - Calls the next middleware or handler function using `await call_next(request)`. - Closes the database connection using `request.state.db.close()`, regardless of whether an exception was raised during the execution of the previous step. - Returns the response generated by the previous step.
