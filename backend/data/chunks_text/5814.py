- Retrieves all `ModelAdmin` instances registered with Django's Admin site using a list comprehension and iterating over the values of the `_registered` dictionary. - Filters out any non-`ModelAdmin` objects using an `isinstance` check. - Calls the `get_link_model_forms()` method on each remaining `ModelAdmin`, which returns a list of forms used to display links between related models in the Admin interface. This is done during the "all pre" phase of registering administrations, allowing these forms to be included in the final registration process.
