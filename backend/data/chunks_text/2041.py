- This function is a plugin for MkDocs that modifies pages before they are rendered (i.e., it's called during the "pre-processing" phase). - It takes three arguments: `Page`, which represents the current page being processed; `config`, which provides access to configuration settings; and `files`, which contains information about all of the files in the project. - The function simply returns the original `Page` object unmodified, meaning it doesn't make any changes to the page content or metadata.
