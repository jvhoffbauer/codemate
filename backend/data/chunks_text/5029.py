1. Defines a function `setup_error_handlers()` that takes an instance of `FastAPI` as input and sets up error handlers for specific exceptions using the `add_exception_handler()` method provided by FastAPI.
2. Handles `UnicornException`, which is assumed to be a custom exception type defined in this application, with a user-defined handler called `unicorn_exception_handler`.
3. Handles `ValidationError`, which represents errors caused by invalid data or schema violations during model validation, with a handler that returns a JSON response containing an error message and details about the validation failures.
4. Converts `ApiException`, which may represent business logic errors, into a Pydantic `Result` object that can be easily consumed by clients via RESTful APIs.
5. Provides a generic handler for all other types of exceptions (i.e., `Exception`) that simply raises them without any additional processing. This allows developers to debug unexpected issues more efficiently while still providing informative error messages to end-users.
