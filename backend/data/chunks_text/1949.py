- Defines an asynchronous function `main()`.
- Returns a `StreamingResponse` object that wraps the output of `fake_video_streamer()`, which is assumed to be a generator yielding video frames or data chunks for streaming.
- This allows Flask to serve the streamed content directly without buffering it in memory, making it more efficient and scalable for large videos or live streams.
