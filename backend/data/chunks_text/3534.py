- Defines a GET request for items with an ID specified in the URL parameter `id`.
- The returned data type is not explicitly defined, but can be assumed to be JSON or another format based on the API's design choices.
- The function body currently contains no implementation and is marked as uncovered by test coverage tools (pragma: no cover). This may indicate that further development is needed before testing can begin.
