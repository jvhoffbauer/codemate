- Defines a `FilterSelectPerm` class that extends `SelectPerm`, which is used to select data using filter clauses in Django's ORM. - The `filters` attribute of this class can be set to a list containing filter expressions (e.g., `Q(age__gt=25)`) for selecting specific records based on certain conditions. - When called by an `admin.ModelAdmin` object during querying, it returns the original selection statement with the specified filters applied using the `filter()` method provided by Django's QuerySet API.
