- Creates a temporary directory using PyTest's TempPathFactory and sets it as the current working directory (CWD). - Initializes a SQLite database named `sql_app.db` in the temporary directory, deleting any existing file with that name. - Imports the `alt_main` module from the `docs_src.sql_databases.sql_app_py39` package, which is assumed to contain the Flask application for testing. - Reloads the imported module to ensure all its imports and initialization steps are executed again during each test run. - Yields an instance of Flask's TestClient class, which can be used to make requests against the app under test. - Deletes the created SQLite database at the end of the test session, unless it was deleted by another test case. - Restores the original CWD before returning control to PyTest.
