- Initializes a function called `create_redis_pool()`, which is asynchronous (marked by `async`) and returns nothing (no return statement). - Inside this function, it creates a new connection pool for Redis using the `create_pool()` method provided by the `aioredis` library. - The arguments passed to `create_pool()` are an instance of the `RedisSettings` class, containing the host and port settings for connecting to Redis. These settings are retrieved from the `settings` module, which presumably contains configuration data loaded at startup time.
