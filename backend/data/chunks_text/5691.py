- Defines a class property called `labels`, which returns a list of all label strings from the `choices` tuple defined on this model's Meta class (i.e., the second item in each pair). - This can be used to easily access and iterate over all available choices without having to unpack the `choices` tuple every time it is needed, as well as avoiding repetitive string literals throughout the application.
