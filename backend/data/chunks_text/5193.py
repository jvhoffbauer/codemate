- This function returns a list of supported assets for a given dataset using FastAPI's dependency injection mechanism to pass in necessary parameters such as the path to the dataset and any required reader options. - The `@self.router.get()` decorator is used to define an HTTP GET endpoint at the specified URL (in this case, `/assets`) that returns a list of strings representing the asset names. - The `response_model` parameter specifies that the returned data should be modeled as a list of strings, which will automatically generate appropriate JSON output when the API is called.
