- Generates an OpenAPI v3.1.0 schema for a FastAPI application using Pydantic models as input. - The generated schema is returned in JSON format when accessing `/openapi.json`. - The schema includes information about endpoints (e.g., GET /items/, POST /items/) and their request/response formats (e.g., body parameters, headers). - In this specific example, the endpoint `POST /items/` has a YAML-formatted request body with required fields `name` and `tags`, both of type string.
