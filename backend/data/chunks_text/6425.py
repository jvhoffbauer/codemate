- This function takes a `Dependant` object as input and modifies its query parameters to be included in the request body instead. - It then clears out the original query parameter list of the dependent object. - The function recursively calls itself on any nested dependencies (i.e., objects that have their own dependencies). - For each field in the updated request body, it sets the embed flag to true, indicating that related resources should also be returned with this request.
