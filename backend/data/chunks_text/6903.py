- Defines a function `stop_app_handler` that takes an instance of `FastAPI` as input and returns another callable function (i.e., a closure). - The inner function `shutdown` is defined inside this closure, which logs a message to the application's logger when called. - This inner function also calls a helper function `_shutdown_model`, passing in the original `FastAPI` instance as its argument. However, we don't have access to this helper function since it's not provided in the given snippet.
