- Initializes a new instance of `AdminUI` with an `AdminApp` object passed as argument to the constructor. - Calls the parent class' constructor using Python's built-in `super()`. - Checks whether FastAPI has generated documentation URLs (i.e., docs and redoc). If so, registers two types of admin interfaces for managing those resources: `DocsAdmin` and `ReDocsAdmin`, respectively.
