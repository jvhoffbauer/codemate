- Imports and sets up necessary modules for testing a SQLAlchemy tutorial example (docs_src, sqlalchemy).
- Defines a function `test_tutorial001` with a parameter `clear_sqlmodel`, which is used to clear the database before running each test case.
- Import the specific module being tested (`tutorial001`) and assign it to a variable called `mod`.
- Set the URL of the SQLite database and create an engine using `create_engine()`.
- Call the main function in the imported module (`mod.main()`), which creates tables based on defined classes.
- Create an instance of `Inspector` class to check if the created tables exist in the database.
- Assert that both Heroes and Teams tables are present in the database after executing the tests.
