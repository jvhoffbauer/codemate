- This function retrieves a list of `Item` objects using FastAPI's dependency injection and SQLAlchemy's CRUD operations. - It takes three arguments: `skip`, `limit`, and `current_user`. - The returned value is a list of documents (`docs`) that are either fetched from the database without any filtering for superusers or filtered to show only those belonging to the authenticated user otherwise.
