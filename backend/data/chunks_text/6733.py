- Defines a function `capture_events()` that takes a `monkeypatch` object as an argument and returns another function (an inner function).
- Inside the inner function, creates an empty list called `events`.
- Retrieves the current Sentry hub's client using `Sentry_SDK.Hub.current.client`.
- Stores two functions `old_capture_event` and `old_capture_envelope`, which are originally used by the client to capture events and envelopes respectively.
- Creates new functions `append_event` and `append_envelope` that store each event or envelope into the `events` list before passing it on to the original functions.
- Sets these new functions as replacements for the original ones using `monkeypatch.setattr()`.
- Returns the `events` list from the outer function.
