- Defines an asynchronous function called `callback3` that takes a single argument, `level3`, of type string. - The function body is empty and marked with the `pragma: nocover` directive to indicate that it should not be executed during testing or coverage analysis. This may suggest that this function is used for some external integration or event handling purpose but its implementation has not been written yet.
