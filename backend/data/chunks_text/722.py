- Creates a `CorrelationIdFilter` instance and sets up variables for the correlation ID (`cid`) and log record (`log_record`) to be tested. - Asserts that the initial log record doesn't have a `correlation_id`. - Calls the `filter()` method of the created filter with the prepared log record as an argument. - Asserts that after calling the filter, the log record now contains the expected correlation ID value (`cid`).
