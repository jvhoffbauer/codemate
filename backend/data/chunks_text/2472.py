- This function, `test_double_invalid()`, uses PyTest's context manager to raise a `ResponseValidationError` when making an HTTP GET request for a non-existent resource at "/items/innerinvalid". - The error raised is specifically a `ResponseValidationError`, which indicates that the response received from the server did not conform to the expected format or structure. - By testing this scenario, we can ensure that our application handles invalid requests gracefully and returns appropriate errors to the user.
