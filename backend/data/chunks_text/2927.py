- Override a dependency (in this case `get_user`) with a custom implementation (`get_user_override`) for testing purposes using Flask's `app.dependency_overrides`. - Make an HTTP GET request to the "/user" endpoint and store the response in `response`. - Assert that the JSON response contains specific values for the user object, scopes, and data array. - Remove the overridden dependencies from the application context after the test is complete by resetting `app.dependency_overrides` to its original state.
