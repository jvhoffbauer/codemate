- Generates an OpenAPI schema for a FastAPI application using `client.get("/openapi.json")`.
- Asserts that the status code is 200 and checks the text content if necessary.
- Verifies that the JSON response matches the expected structure with specific keys such as 'openapi', 'info', 'paths', and 'components'.
- Confirms that the HTTP authentication scheme (in this case, HTTP Digest) is included in the security section of the schema.
