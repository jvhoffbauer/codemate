- This function tests a specific tutorial (tutorial001_py310 in this case) by using `clear_sqlmodel` to clear any existing SQLModel data, then running the tutorial's main function while capturing print statements and checking that they match expected output. - The `get_testing_print_function` is used to capture all printed messages during execution of the tutorial's main function. - The captured print statements are stored in the `calls` list for later comparison against an expected set of prints.
