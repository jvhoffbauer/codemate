- This decorator is used to validate a configuration variable named "SENTRY_DSN" before it's set in the class constructor. - The `pre=True` argument specifies that this validation should be performed prior to any other validations defined on the same variable. - If the value of "SENTRY_DSN" is empty or blank, the function returns `None`, effectively ignoring the variable during initialization. Otherwise, the original value is returned as is.
