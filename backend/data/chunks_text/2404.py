- Defines an asynchronous route `/async` using FastAPI's decorator syntax
- Accepts a dependency `state` of type `Depends`, which is generated by calling `asyncgen_state()` function (not shown here) that returns an async generator object
- Returns the value yielded from the async generator, effectively returning the final result when the generator completes execution
