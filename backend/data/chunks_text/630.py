- This function tests a tutorial in SQLAlchemy's documentation by creating an instance of the `app` and `database` classes defined in the tutorial's Python file (`tutorial001_py39`) using fixtures provided by Pytest. - The `sqlite_url` attribute is set to a local SQLite database for testing purposes. - A mock object called `new_print` is created using the `get_testing_print_function` utility function provided by Pytest. - The built-in `print` function is replaced with this mock object during the execution of the application using the `patch` decorator. - After running the application, the contents of the `expected_calls` list are compared against the actual output captured by the `new_print` mock object to verify that the correct print statements were executed as part of the tutorial.
