- `_regenerate_error_with_loc()` is a helper function that takes two arguments - `errors`, which is a sequence of error objects, and `loc_prefix`, which is a tuple containing location information such as file names and line numbers.
- The function returns a list of dictionaries representing updated error objects with additional 'loc' keys added to them using the provided `loc_prefix`. This allows for more detailed error messages with specific locations within the codebase.
- The function uses another internal function called `_normalize_errors()` to normalize the input errors before updating their locations.
