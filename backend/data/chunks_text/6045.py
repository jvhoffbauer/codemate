- Registers a custom admin for Django's built-in `User` model using the `@site.register_admin` decorator. - Defines a new subclass of `django.contrib.auth.admin.UserAdmin`, which is used to manage user accounts in the Django administration interface. - Sets the `model` attribute to point to our app's `User` model (which inherits from Django's built-in `AbstractBaseUser`). - Adds two items to the `list_filter` and `search_fields` attributes, respectively, allowing users to filter and search by either the primary key or username field when managing their own account in the admin interface.
