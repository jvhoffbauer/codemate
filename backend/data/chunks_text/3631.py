- Defines a function named 'new_subscription' which takes two arguments - 'body' and 'token'.
- The 'body' argument is of type 'Subscription', representing the subscription details being created by the user.
- The 'token' argument is annotated using FastAPI's security feature (Security decorator) with bearer scheme authentication. This means it expects an authorization header containing a Bearer token as part of the incoming HTTP request.
