- This function tests a specific tutorial (tutorial001 in connect/update) by using pytest fixtures to clear SQLModel's metadata and replace builtin print statements for testing purposes. - The `create_engine()` method is called with the URL provided by the module, which creates an engine object that can be used to interact with the database. - A list named 'calls' is created to store any output printed during the execution of the main function. - The `get_testing_print_function()` function is imported from pytest to replace the builtin print statement temporarily. - The `patch()` decorator is used to replace the builtin print statement with our custom one, so we can capture all outputs produced during the execution of the main function. - Finally, the main function is executed within this context manager, and the captured outputs are compared against expected values using assertions.
