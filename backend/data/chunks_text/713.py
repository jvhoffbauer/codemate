- Tests the `no_validator_or_transformer_app` application that doesn't validate or transform request IDs using Starlette's built-in middleware. - Uses the `AsyncClient` to make a GET request to the 'test' endpoint and sets an invalid UUID ('bad-uuid') in the X-Request-ID header. - Asserts that the returned response contains the same invalid UUID value in its own X-Request-ID header.
