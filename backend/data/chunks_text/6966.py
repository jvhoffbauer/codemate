- Defines a fixture named `connection` using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture()` decorator. - Uses AsyncIOMotorEngine to create an asynchronous database connection (`conn`) and begins a transaction (`engine.begin()`). - Yields the connection for use in tests, then rolls back any changes made during testing using `await conn.rollback()`.
