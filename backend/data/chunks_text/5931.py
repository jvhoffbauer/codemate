- `annotation_outer_type()` function takes a type parameter (`tp`) and returns its outermost type. - If `tp` is `Ellipsis`, it returns `Any`. - It checks whether `tp` has an origin using `get_origin()`. - If `tp`'s origin is either `Union` or `Annotated`, it continues to next iteration. - For specific origins like `Sequence`, it returns their corresponding types from a dictionary called `sequence_annotation_to_type`. - If `tp`'s origin is `dict` or derived from `BaseModel`, it returns that origin. - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself on each argument until it finds the outermost type.
