- Tests that making a GET request to `/users/me` without providing an authentication token returns a HTTP status code of 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and an error message indicating that the 'token' query parameter is missing. - The error message conforms to the OpenAPI specification for this endpoint as defined by the `match_pydantic_error_url` function from FastAPI's built-in error handling module. - This test also includes a fallback error message format for older versions of Pydantic that will be removed in future releases.
