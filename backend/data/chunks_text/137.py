- Defines a function called `select` with four arguments (`__ent0`, `__ent1`, `__ent2`, and `entity_3`) of specific types (_TCCA_, _T0_, _T1_, _T2_, and _TScalar_3). The first three arguments are annotated as collections while the last argument is a scalar value. - Returns a new object of type `Select` that combines elements from the input collections based on a specified condition represented by the scalar value `entity_3`. This operation is commonly used in database queries to filter or project data.
