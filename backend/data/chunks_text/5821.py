- This method `get_page_schema()` returns an optional `PageSchema`, which represents the schema of a Google Sheets page. - If there's already a `PageSchema` object returned by the parent class, this method checks whether its `tabsMode` property (which determines how tabs are displayed in the sheet) is set to `None`. - If so, it sets both `tabsMode` and `schemaApi` (an API used for generating schemas from data) to `None`. The reason behind setting these properties to `None` is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, it could be assumed that they may cause issues or conflicts with other parts of the program when left uninitialized. By initializing them here, any potential problems can be avoided.
