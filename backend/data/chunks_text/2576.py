- This function takes a `credentials` parameter as optional and returns either an error message or an object containing authentication scheme and credentials for the current user, based on whether `credentials` are provided or not. - The `Security` decorator from FastAPI's security middleware is used to extract HTTP authorization headers automatically. - If `credentials` are not passed, this function returns an error message asking the user to create an account instead.
