- Defines a `FrozenAttributes` class called `Algorithms`, which has a dictionary attribute `data` containing type hinted subclasses of `BaseAlgorithm`. - Provides methods to fetch, list, and register algorithms dynamically at runtime. - Includes a FastAPI dependency function that allows passing an algorithm's name or instance with optional parameters via query string arguments. - Raises appropriate exceptions when necessary (such as key errors, validation errors, etc.).
