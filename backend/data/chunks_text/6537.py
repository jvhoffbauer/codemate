- Defines a list of supported OpenAPI versions using `packaging.version`.
- Checks whether Pydantic version is greater than or equal to 1.10.0. If yes, defines an inner function called `_openapi_compatible` that takes a dictionary as input, checks if its 'openapi' key has a compatible version, replaces it with `ANY`, and returns the modified dictionary. - If Pydantic version is less than 1.10.0, defines another inner function called `_openapi_compatible` that recursively applies itself on all nested dictionaries, removes the 'default' field from objects containing both 'const' and 'default', checks compatibility of 'openapi' key, replaces it with `ANY`, and returns the modified object. - Returns either one of these functions based on the Pydantic version check.
