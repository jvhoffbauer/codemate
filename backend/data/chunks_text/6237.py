- Defines an abstract method called `get()` for retrieving a specific location by ID in asynchronous mode using Python's `async/await` syntax. - Raises a `NotImplementedError`, indicating that this method must be overridden (implemented) in subclasses of this class. - Follows PEP8 naming conventions for methods starting with lowercase letters and using snake_case instead of CamelCase or PascalCase.
