- This function tests a specific example in the SQLModel tutorial (tutorial002).
- It sets up the necessary variables and functions for running the tutorial, including creating an engine using SQLAlchemy's `create_engine`.
- It patches the built-in `print` function to capture its output during the execution of the tutorial.
- The captured outputs are stored in a list called `calls`, which can be inspected after the fact to verify that the expected messages were printed by the tutorial.
