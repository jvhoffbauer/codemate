- Override `common_parameters` dependency with a custom implementation that includes an additional sub-dependency (`overrider_dependency_with_sub`) in the main endpoint's request handler function (`client.get("/main-depends/")`). - Test if the override works by making a GET request to the main endpoint and checking for a specific error message returned by Flask-Pydantic (`IsDict({"detail": [...]}))`. - Verify that the original dependencies are restored after testing is complete using `app.dependency_overrides = {}`.
