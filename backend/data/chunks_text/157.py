- Defines a function called `select` with four arguments (`entity_0`, `__ent1`, `entity_2`, and `entity_3`) of types `_TScalar_0`, `_TCCA[_T1]`, `_TScalar_2`, and `_TScalar_3`, respectively. The first argument is annotated with a type hint that's ignored by mypy. - Returns a new object of type `Select` containing tuples consisting of values from the original inputs. This implementation assumes that `_TScalar_0` can be converted to a tuple with elements of types `_TCCA[_T1]`, `_TScalar_2`, and `_TScalar_3`. - Note that the second argument is prefixed with two underscores, indicating it's a positional-only parameter in Python.
