- Defines an endpoint `/point/{lon},{lat}` that returns a value for a specific location using Pydantic's Path dependency to validate input parameters and FastAPI's Dependencies feature to pass them downstream. - Uses RasterIO library to read the data from the specified file path (`src_path`) based on user-defined parameters such as layers, datasets, readers, environment variables, etc., stored in separate dependencies. - Returns a dictionary containing coordinates, values, and band names of the requested point.
