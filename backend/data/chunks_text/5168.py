1. This function `geojson_statistics()` takes a GeoJSON object (either a single feature or a collection of features) and returns statistics calculated on its associated raster data using various dependencies provided by other functions.
2. The function first checks whether the input is a single feature or a collection; if it's just one feature, it converts it to a collection containing that feature.
3. It then opens the raster file specified by the `src_path` parameter using the `Reader` class created by another dependency function. Various parameters are passed to this function to customize how the raster is read.
4. For each feature in the collection, the function extracts the relevant portion of the raster using the `feature()` method of the `SourceDataset` returned by the `Reader`. Other parameters are also passed here to control how the extraction is done.
5. Using yet more dependencies, the extracted array is processed to calculate statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, etc., which are stored in a dictionary called `stats`.
6. These statistics are added to the properties of the corresponding feature in the GeoJSON object, under a new key named `statistics`. Each band of the raster is represented separately within this nested dictionary.
