- Tests a JSON RPC request with no parameters for the `no_params()` method using the `json_request()` helper function and asserts that the expected result is returned by the server (represented by the `resp` variable). - The `assert resp == {"id": 111, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": "123"}` line checks if the response from the server matches the expected output specified in the test case.
