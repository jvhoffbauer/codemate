- Defines a function called `router_decorator_depends()` that returns an object with a key 'in' and value 'router-decorator-depends'. - This function is likely used as a decorator for FastAPI routers to specify dependencies required by specific endpoints. - The 'in' key in this context may refer to the HTTP request method (GET, POST, etc.) on which these endpoint dependencies are applied.
