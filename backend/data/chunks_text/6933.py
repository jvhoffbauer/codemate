- Endpoint for checking server health using FastAPI's built-in `health` endpoint with a custom implementation that uses SQLAlchemy to execute a query and returns a 204 response if successful or a 503 response on timeouts or connection errors. - Uses dependency injection to pass an instance of the database session to the function. - Utilizes Python's `asyncio` module to add asynchronous behavior to the query execution and handle potential timeouts or connection errors.
