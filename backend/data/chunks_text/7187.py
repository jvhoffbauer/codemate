- This function takes a plain text password as input and returns its hashed version using Python's built-in `pwd` module for secure password storage. - The returned value is in string format, which can be stored in a database or used to compare against user inputs during login attempts. - Using this function instead of storing plain text passwords helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data by making it more difficult for attackers to guess or crack passwords through brute force attacks.
