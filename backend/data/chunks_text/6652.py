- This function is a middleware that intercepts JSON RPC requests and raises an exception to test error handling in the server implementation. - It keeps track of request IDs and their corresponding entry/exit events with additional information about the context and any exceptions raised during execution. - The `yield` statement allows other middleware or handlers to execute before returning control back to this middleware for logging exit event data.
