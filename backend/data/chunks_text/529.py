- This function tests a specific example (tutorial003_py310) in the SQLModel documentation by using pytest fixtures to clear the database and set up the necessary variables for running the example. - The `create_engine()` function is used to connect to an SQLite database, which is then passed to the main function of the tutorial module. - A mocking library called `unittest.mock` is used to capture standard output printed during execution, allowing us to verify that the correct statements are being executed.
