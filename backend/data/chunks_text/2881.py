- This fixture is automatically called by PyTest before each test function using `autouse=True`. - It creates two new variables, `fake_database` and `state`, which are copies of their respective initial values (stored in `initial_fake_database` and `initial_state`). - The purpose of this setup is to ensure that the database and application state are reset between tests, allowing for more reliable testing of individual functions without interference from previous or subsequent tests.
