- Defines a function called `select` with four arguments (`__ent0`, `entity_1`, `__ent2`, and `entity_3`) that are annotated as specific types using type hints. The first argument is ignored for some reason. - Returns a new object of type `Select` which contains tuples consisting of elements from both input sequences based on specified conditions defined by `entity_1` and `entity_3`. This operation is commonly used in database queries to filter and project data.
