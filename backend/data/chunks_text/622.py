- This function tests the `tutorial002` example in the SQLModel documentation by running it and checking that certain print statements are called (stored in a list).
- The `clear_sqlmodel` fixture is used to clear any existing database connections before each test, ensuring isolation between tests.
- The `get_testing_print_function` helper function is used to capture standard output during the execution of the tested module, allowing for verification of its behavior without actually printing anything to the console.
