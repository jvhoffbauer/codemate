- Defines a function called `select` with three arguments (`entity_0`, `entity_1`, and `__ent2`) that are annotated as generic types using underscores (_). The first two arguments represent scalar values of some unspecified type, while the third argument is a collection of elements of another unspecified type (`_T2`). - Returns a new object called `Select` which combines the first two scalar inputs with one element from the collection specified by the third input parameter. This operation is performed through a generic class called `Select`.
