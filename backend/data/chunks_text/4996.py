- Defines a class method called `create` that takes keyword arguments (`**kwargs`) and returns an instance of the model created using Django's built-in `create()` function from the `objects` manager. - The `Self` type hint is used to indicate that this method should return an instance of the same model it belongs to. This allows for easier chaining of methods in fluent interfaces.
