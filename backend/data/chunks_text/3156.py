- This endpoint retrieves a user with the given ID using FastAPI's dependency injection mechanism to ensure that the requested user exists before executing the function. - The `@app.get()` decorator specifies an HTTP GET request, and the path parameter `{user_id}` is bound to the integer value passed in the URL (e.g., /users/123). - The `dependencies` argument takes a list of functions or classes that will be called as part of the request processing pipeline, allowing for complex validation logic without cluttering the main function body. In this case, we are passing our custom `user_exists` function, which likely checks if the specified user actually exists in some data store like a database or cache.
