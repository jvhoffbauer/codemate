- Defines an `async` function called `catcher`.
- Takes a websocket and a callback function (`call_next`) as arguments.
- Uses a `try` block to wrap the execution of `call_next()`, which is assumed to be another asynchronous function that returns an object or value.
- If any exception occurs inside the `try` block, it's caught by the `except` clause and added to a list named `caught`.
- The raised exception is then rethrown using the `raise` statement, effectively propagating the error upstream for further handling.
