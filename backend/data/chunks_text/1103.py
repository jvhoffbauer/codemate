- This function handles a POST request to the `/token` endpoint for logging in using OAuth2 authentication.
- It takes an instance of `Annotated[OAuth2PasswordRequestForm, Depends()]`, which is a Pydantic model that validates and parses the form data sent by the client.
- The function retrieves the user's dictionary from a mock database (`fake_users_db`) based on the provided username. If the user doesn't exist, it raises an error with status code 400.
- The function checks whether the hash of the entered password matches the stored one for the given user. If they don't match, it also raises an error with status code 400.
- Finally, the function returns a JSON response containing the access token (which is just the username), and the type of token ("bearer").
