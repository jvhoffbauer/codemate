- Tests handling of disconnections in a websocket server using FastAPI and Starlette's built-in WebSocket functionality
- Creates two simultaneous connections to different endpoints (/ws/1234 and /ws/5678)
- Sends a message through one connection and receives it back, verifying that the received message matches what was sent
- Receives a message from the other connection, which should contain information about the sender and their message
- Closes the second connection and receives a notification on the first connection indicating that the second user has left the chat
