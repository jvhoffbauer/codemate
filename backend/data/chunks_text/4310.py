- Defines an asynchronous function `large()` that returns a plain text response with the string "x" repeated 4000 times and sets its HTTP status code to 200 (OK). - The returned object is of type `PlainTextResponse`, which is a subclass of `StreamingBody`. This allows for streaming responses instead of loading the entire content into memory at once.
