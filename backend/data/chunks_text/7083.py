- This function tests the use of an access token to authenticate a login request for a user named 'test-token'. - It uses the `TestClient` class from django-rest-framework's testing utilities to make requests against the API. - The `superuser_token_headers` dictionary is passed as an argument and contains the necessary authentication credentials (e.g., username and password). - The response status code is checked to ensure it's 200 OK. - The JSON response body is parsed and verified that it includes the expected key ('email').
