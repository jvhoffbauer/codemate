- This function retrieves a list of User objects from the database using SQLAlchemy's `Session` object and returns them as a list of `UserOut` instances (which is likely a custom data transfer object for serialization purposes). - The function takes two optional arguments, `skip` and `limit`, which allow paginating through the results by specifying an offset and number of items to retrieve at once.
