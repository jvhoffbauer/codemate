- Defines a new endpoint `/post-callback` using FastAPI's decorator syntax and specifies its HTTP method as POST.
- Specifies that the function should return an array of `Item` objects (as defined by some other part of our application) when called successfully, with a status code of 200 OK.
- Includes a custom `generate_unique_id_Function`, which is used to generate unique IDs for requests made through this endpoint. This can be useful in situations where multiple requests are being processed simultaneously or concurrently.
- Also defines a specific error response for status code 404 NOT FOUND, returning an array of `Message` objects instead of the default JSON response. This allows us to provide more detailed information about why the request failed.
