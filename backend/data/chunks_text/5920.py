- Defines a function `marge_model_config` that takes in two arguments - `model`, which is an instance of `BaseModel`, and `update`, which is a dictionary containing updates to be made to the configuration of the model.
- The function returns either a new type (i.e., class) or a dictionary based on whether the input `model` is already a subclass of `BaseConfig`. If it's not, the function creates a new subclass by merging the existing configuration from `model.model_config` with the provided updates using Python's dictionary unpacking syntax (`**`) and returning this new subclass as the result. Otherwise, if `model` is already a subclass of `BaseConfig`, the function simply returns the merged configuration as a dictionary instead of creating a new subclass.
