- This method is called by Django Rest Framework to check if a user has permission to perform an action (e.g., create, update, delete). - It takes two arguments: `request`, which represents the HTTP request being made, and `name`, which is the name of the action being performed. - The implementation simply returns `True`, granting all users permission to perform any action. In practice, this would typically be replaced with more complex logic that checks the user's role or other permissions before allowing them to proceed.
