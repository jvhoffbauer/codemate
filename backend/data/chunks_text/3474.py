- Defines an asynchronous function named `create_product` that accepts a single argument `data`, which is expected to be of type `Product`. The value passed for this parameter will be obtained from the request body using FastAPI's built-in `Body()` parser with specific media types and embedding behavior specified. - If the provided data conforms to the expected format (i.e., it's a valid `Product` object), it will be embedded in the response by default; otherwise, it won't be included. - This function doesn't perform any actual product creation logic since its purpose is just to demonstrate how to use FastAPI's parsing features when working with complex objects like `Product`.
