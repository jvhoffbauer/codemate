- Method `close()` closes the file and returns none asynchronously using Python's built-in `asyncio` library. - The method uses a superclass to inherit its functionality while still being able to add new features specific to this class (i.e., making it awaitable). - This allows for more efficient use of resources by running I/O operations concurrently instead of blocking the main event loop.
