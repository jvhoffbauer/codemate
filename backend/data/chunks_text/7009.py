- Retrieves a list of items from the database using FastAPI's dependency injection and SQLAlchemy's `crud` functions for CRUD operations. - Allows pagination with the `skip` and `limit` parameters. - Checks whether the authenticated user is an administrator (i.e., has superuser privileges) before allowing access to all items in the system; otherwise, restricts results to those owned by the current user.
