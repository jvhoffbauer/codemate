- This function takes a type `tp` as input and returns its inner type for use in sequence types, such as lists or tuples. - It uses the `get_origin()`, `is_union()`, and `Annotation` functions from Python's typing module to determine whether the given type is a union or annotated type. - If it is neither, it simply returns `Any`. - For unions, it recursively calls itself with the first argument of the union. - For annotations, it also recursively calls itself with the first argument of the annotation. - Finally, for regular sequences without any special types, it returns the outer type of the first element using another helper function called `annotation_outer_type()`.
