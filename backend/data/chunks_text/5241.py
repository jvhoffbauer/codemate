- Initializes `asset_indexes` and `asset_expression` dictionaries with values from class attributes of the same name. - Converts string keys to lists using a list comprehension that splits the index or expression strings by '|' and converts the second part (the indices or expression) into an integer list. - Uses type hinting to specify the types of the resulting dictionaries.
