- Defines a function `get_sync_async` that takes an optional argument `state`, which is obtained using the `Depends()` decorator and passed to it asynchronously through `asyncgen_state`. - Returns the value of the `state` parameter, regardless of whether it was provided synchronously or asynchronously. This allows for easy conversion between synchronous and asynchronous contexts in FastAPI applications.
