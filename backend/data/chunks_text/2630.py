- Defines a GET request endpoint for `/items/`.
- Returns a JSON response with an ID of 'foo'.

2) Given the following source code, what is the purpose of the `@app.post()` decorator and how should I structure my request body to use this endpoint? Answer according to: This endpoint allows you to create new items.

```
@app.post("/items/", status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
def create_item(item: Item):
    # TODO: Implement item creation logic
    pass
```

Purpose of `@app.post()` decorator: Marks this function as a POST request handler for the specified URL path (`"/items/"`). The HTTP status code returned by this function will be set to `HTTP_201_CREATED`, indicating that a resource has been created successfully.

Structure of request body: The request body must contain a valid instance of the `Item` model class defined elsewhere in your application. In other words, you'll need to include all required fields for creating a new item, such as its name or description. Here's an example request body using Python's built-in `json` module:

```python
import json

data = {
    "name": "My New Item",
    "description": "This is a test item.",
}
request_body = json.dumps(data).encode("utf-8")
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/items/", data=request_body)
print(response.content.decode())
```
