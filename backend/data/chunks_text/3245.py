- Defines a Pydantic model `ModelNoAlias` without using an alias for it in this function's response schema definition. - Returns an instance of the `ModelNoAlias` class with a value for its required field 'name'. - Uses the `response_model` decorator to specify that the returned object should be serialized according to the `ModelNoAlias` schema, rather than being automatically converted into JSON or another format based on its type.
