- This function is used to roll back database changes made during an upgrade process using Flask-Migrate and SQLAlchemy's Alembic toolkit.
- The `downgrade()` function contains a series of SQL statements that reverse the effects of previous migrations, as specified in comments marked with "### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust!" and "### end Alembic commands ###".
- Specifically, this example code drops the `item`, `user`, and `ix_user_email` tables from the database.
