- Defines a function `simple_include_dict()` that returns a dictionary with nested dictionaries representing models and their attributes. - The outer dictionary has keys'ref' and 'baz'. - The key'ref' contains two subdictionaries, each representing an attribute of a different model ('foo' and 'bar'). - The value for 'baz' is not part of any nested structure but represents another model's attribute ('model2') directly.
