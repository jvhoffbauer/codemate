- Defines a function `Field()` that takes several optional arguments to customize the behavior of a model field during serialization and deserialization using Marshmallow's ORM extension for SQLAlchemy (SA).
- The function returns an instance of `FieldInfo`, which contains metadata about the field such as its default value, aliases, titles, descriptions, exclusion/inclusion rules, constraints, validation options, and SA integration settings like primary keys, foreign keys, uniqueness, nullability, indices, and column definitions.
- Some of the most commonly used parameters are `default`, `default_factory`, `alias`, `title`, `description`, `exclude`, `include`, `primary_key`, `foreign_key`, `unique`, `nullable`, `index`, `sa_type`, and `sa_column`. These can be set to modify various aspects of how the field is serialized and deserialized, as well as how it interacts with the database through SA.
- Other less frequently used parameters include `const`, `gt`, `ge`, `lt`, `le`, `multiple_of`, `max_digits`, `decimal_places`, `min_items`, `max_items`, `unique_items`, `min_length`, `max_length`, `allow_mutation`, `regex`, `discriminator`, `repr`, `schema_extra`, and `post_init_field_info`. These provide more fine-grained control over specific features of the fields, such as constant values, numerical comparisons, string patterns, nested lists/dictionaries, and additional JSON Schema extensions.
