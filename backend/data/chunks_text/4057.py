- This function is a unit test for getting an item with ID 2 using Flask's built-in testing client (client).
- It asserts that the status code of the response should be 200 and displays the text if it fails. Otherwise, it continues to execute further tests.
- The JSON data returned by the server is compared against expected values in another assert statement. If they match, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.
