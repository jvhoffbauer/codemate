- This function, named `read_system_status`, returns a dictionary with a key'status' and value 'ok'.
- It takes one argument `current_user` of type `User`, which is obtained using the `Depends()` decorator to get the current user from the authentication middleware. However, since this function doesn't actually use the `current_user` object, it can be safely removed without affecting the functionality of the API.
