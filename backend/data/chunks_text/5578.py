- This function creates a `SchemaListT` class that represents a list of objects based on the selected entity models and their corresponding fields. - It first retrieves all the relevant fields (excluding labels and saving classes) for the selected entities using the `filter_modelfield()` method provided by Django's `rest_framework`. - Then it uses the `create_model_by_fields()` utility to generate a new `Model` subclass with the specified name, field definitions, and additional options such as allowing null values ('set_none') and accepting extra keyword arguments ('extra').
