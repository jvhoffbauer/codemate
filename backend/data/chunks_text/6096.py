- Defines a function `app_routes` that takes in an instance of FastAPI and a module containing SQLAlchemy models as arguments. - Retrieves the schema for the User model using `TableModelParser`. - Registers CRUD operations for the User model with `SqlalchemyCrud`, specifying the read operation's schema (in this case, the same as the model's schema). - Includes the resulting router in the main FastAPI application. - Repeats steps 2-4 for another model (Tag), but without specifying a read operation schema since it will use the default one provided by `SqlalchemyCrud`.
