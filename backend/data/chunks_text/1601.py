- Defines a middleware function for FastAPI's HTTP requests using `@app.middleware('http')`.
- Initializes a new SQLAlchemy session (using `SessionLocal`) and sets it as an attribute of the application state (`request.state.db`).
- Calls the next handler in the chain (`await call_next(request)`) while passing the modified request object with the database session attached to its state dictionary.
- Closes the database connection after handling the request (`finally: request.state.db.close()`).
- Returns the final response from the next handler or raises an internal server error if any exceptions occur during execution.
