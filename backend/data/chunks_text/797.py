- This function takes a `refresh_token`, an optional flag to indicate whether it has expired (default is false), and returns a dictionary with cookie settings for storing the token securely in HTTP cookies. - The returned dictionary contains several key-value pairs that configure various aspects of the cookie's behavior, such as its name ("key"), whether it should be sent over HTTP connections only ("httponly"), how it interacts with other sites on the user's browser ("samesite"), whether it should be encrypted during transmission ("secure"), and which domain it applies to ("domain"). - If the `expired` flag is true, the function simply returns the basic configuration without setting any value or maximum age for the cookie. Otherwise, it adds the actual `refresh_token` value and sets a specific expiration time (stored in `auth_config`) using the `max_age` parameter.
