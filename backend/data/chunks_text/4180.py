- Defines a fixture named `client` using pytest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called by PyTest before each test that uses it. - Inside the function, we first import the Flask application object (`app`) from a specific module in our project (`docs_src.body_fields.tutorial001_an_py39`). - We then create a new instance of Flask's built-in testing client (`TestClient`) with our imported `app`, and assign it to the variable `client`. - Finally, we return the newly created `client` object so that other tests can use it as needed.
