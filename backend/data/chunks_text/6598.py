- This function is a unit test for a method called `echo`.
- It sends an HTTP request with specific parameters to the server using the `json_request()` function and saves the request ID in a variable named `request_id`.
- The response from the server is stored in a variable named `resp`, which is then compared against expected values using the `assert` statement.
- Finally, it checks if the input string has been passed through the `echo` function by checking its history.
