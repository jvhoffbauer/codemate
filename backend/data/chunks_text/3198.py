- Defines a new subclass of `BaseModel`, called `ModelWithPath`, with an attribute named 'path' that is of type `PurePath`. - If using Dantic version 2, sets the `arbitrary_types_allowed` flag at the module level to allow non-standard types in models. Otherwise, creates a configuration object for the same purpose. - Creates an instance of the `ModelWithPath` class and passes it a `PurePath` object as its 'path' argument. - Uses the `jsonable_encoder()` function from Dantic to convert the object into JSON serializable format, which should include the string representation of the `PurePath` object instead of the actual object itself.
