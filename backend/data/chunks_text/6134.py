- Defines a `UserCrud` object with a customized list of fields that can be updated using SQLAlchemy and Pydantic's `SqlalchemyCrud`. - Registers the crud as a router under the prefix `/user`. - Tests the OpenAPI schema to ensure that the expected fields are excluded from the update request body. - Makes an API call to update the username for user ID 1 successfully. - Makes another API call to attempt updating the password (which is not included in the allowed update fields), resulting in an error response.
