- Defines a custom validation function for Django's built-in `django-rest-framework` package to handle blank Sentry DSNs (error reporting tool). - The function takes in a class and a value as arguments, where 'cls' is the type of field being validated and 'v' is its corresponding value. - If the length of the value ('v') is zero, it returns None, indicating that the validation failed due to an empty string or blank space. Otherwise, it simply passes on the value unchanged.
