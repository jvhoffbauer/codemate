- Defines a method `update_from_dict()` that takes an object (a dictionary) and optional list of field names as arguments. - If no fields are provided, sets all keys from the dictionary to corresponding attributes on self using Python's built-in `setattr()`. - Otherwise, iterates over the specified fields and updates their values with the corresponding key from the dictionary.
