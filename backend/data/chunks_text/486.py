- This is a unit test using pytest's `@pytest.fixture(scope="module")` to clear SQLModel's metadata before each test case. - Imports and initializes necessary modules/functions (e.g., `create_engine`, `get_testing_print_function`) from other parts of the project. - Patches builtin function `print` to capture its output during execution of the tested module (`mod.main()`). - Asserts that specific outputs are printed by checking if they appear in the captured print statements.
