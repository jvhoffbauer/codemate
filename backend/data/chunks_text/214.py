1. Creates a new SQLAlchemy database connection and sets up the necessary metadata for our models to be created in it.
2. Uses `create_engine()` from SQLAlchemy's core module to establish a connection to an SQLite database named 'testing.db'. The `connect_args` parameter specifies that we want to disable thread safety checks, which allows us to use this same connection across multiple threads without issues.
3. Calls `SQLModel.metadata.create_all()` to generate the tables defined by our SQLModel classes based on their attributes. This ensures that the required schema exists before any operations are performed against it.
4. Initializes a new FastAPI application instance using the `TestClient()` function provided by Pytest to simulate HTTP requests during testing. We also set up a dependency override for the `SessionLocal()` function used to retrieve sessions from the database. By doing so, we can ensure that each request uses its own isolated session instead of sharing one between all requests.
5. Defines a custom implementation of the `get_session()` function that returns the current session obtained through the `SessionLocal()` context manager. This overridden version will be used when resolving dependencies within our FastAPI routes.
6. Makes a POST request to the '/heroes/' endpoint passing a JSON body containing the name and secret name of a hero. After executing the request, we clear the dependency overrides and access the response data to verify that everything worked correctly.
