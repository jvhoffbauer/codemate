- Defines a fixture named `app` for use in tests within this module, using the `scope="module"` argument to make it available throughout the entire test suite. - Uses a context manager (the `with` statement) and the `pytest.warns()` function to suppress DeprecationWarnings that may be raised when importing the `app` object from another file called `tutorial001`. - Yields the imported `app` object so it can be used by other fixtures or tests that depend on it.
