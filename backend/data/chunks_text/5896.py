1. This function is called to retrieve a specific form item based on a given `Request`, `ModelField`, and `CrudEnum`. It filters out certain fields for creation, updating, filtering, and listing purposes.
2. The `action` parameter determines whether this function should be used for list display (`list`) or filtering (`filter`). If it's `list`, then all excluded fields are returned as `None`. Otherwise, the function proceeds with retrieval of the requested field.
3. The `exclude` variable contains a list of denied fields obtained from another method `get_deny_fields()`. These fields will not appear in any forms generated by FastAPI.
