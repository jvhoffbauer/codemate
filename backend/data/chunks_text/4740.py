- This function tests the main application by cleaning up existing static and template directories, copying new ones over, creating a Flask app instance, making requests to specific URLs, checking status codes and content, then removing the copied directories again. - The `shutil.rmtree()` function is used to delete entire directory trees recursively. - The `TestClient()` class provided by Flask's testing module is used to make HTTP requests against the app being tested.
