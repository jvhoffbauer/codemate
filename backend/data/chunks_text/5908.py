- This function is an asynchronous method called `_call`. It takes three arguments: a `ModelAdmin`, a `Request`, and a `Select` object (which represents a SQL query).
- The function retrieves the current user from Django's authentication system using the `get_current_user()` method of the site instance associated with the `ModelAdmin`. If no user is found, it returns a modified version of the original `Select` that always evaluates to false (i.e., filters out all results), effectively denying access to unauthenticated users.
- The function then extracts the name of the column in the model being administered by the `ModelAdmin` that contains the user ID or username (stored as `self.user_column`) and the corresponding attribute on the User model containing this value (stored as `self.user_attr`). These values are assumed to be set when defining the custom permission class for the `ModelAdmin`.
- Finally, the function modifies the `Select` object returned by the previous step by adding a WHERE clause filtering rows based on the extracted column and its corresponding user information.
