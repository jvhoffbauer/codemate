- This function is called when a user logs out of the application using FastAPI's dependency injection mechanism. - It takes two arguments: `response`, which represents the HTTP response object being sent back to the client, and `refresh_token`, which contains information about the current user's refresh token (obtained from the `Depends()` decorator). - The function calls the `service.expire_refresh_token()` method to remove the associated refresh token from the database. - Finally, it deletes the corresponding cookie containing the refresh token from the client's browser by passing its settings as an argument to the `Response.delete_cookie()` method.
