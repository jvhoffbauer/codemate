- Defines a function `get_current_user()` that takes an optional argument `oauth_header`. If provided, it is passed to the `Security` class with the name `api_key`, which likely represents some kind of authentication key or token. - Inside the function, a new instance of the `User` class is created and initialized with a username property set to the value of the `oauth_header`. This suggests that `oauth_header` contains some form of user identifier or session information. - The resulting `User` object is returned from the function for use elsewhere in the program.
