- This function searches for items in a specified Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket using Elasticsearch's full text search feature. - It takes four arguments: `bucket`, which is the GCS bucket to search; `query_string`, which is the user's search query; and optional `skip` and `limit` values that determine how many results are returned at once. - The function calls another helper function called `utils.search_by_type_get_results_to_docs()` with various parameters specific to this use case, including the name of the Elasticsearch index being searched, the document type to look for, and the model used to convert search results into Python objects.
