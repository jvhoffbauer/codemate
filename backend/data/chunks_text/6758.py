- Tests that creating an API object with `fastapi_jsonrpc_components_fine_names` set to True or False returns a valid FastAPI application without any entrypoint errors. - Uses PyTest's parametrize decorator to run the same test twice with different values for `fastapi_jsonrpc_components_fine_names`. - Verifies that the OpenRPC specification can be retrieved successfully by making a GET request to "/openrpc.json".
