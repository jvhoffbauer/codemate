- Defines a function named `login` that takes an optional argument called `form_data`. This argument is of type `OAuth2PasswordRequestFormStrict`, which is provided by FastAPI's built-in OAuth2 authentication system. - If no value is passed for `form_data`, it defaults to the result of calling `Depends()`. The `Depends()` decorator in FastAPI allows us to pass dependencies between functions, and here we are using it to automatically retrieve the user's credentials from the request context when this function is invoked. - The function simply returns whatever value was passed as `form_data`. In practice, you might use this returned data to authenticate or authorize the user, but for now, we're just returning it so we can see what information is available.
