- Defines a function `get_client()` that imports and returns an instance of Flask's test client for a specific application (specified by its module path). - The imported module is `docs_src.bigger_applications.app_an_py39.main`, which contains the main entry point for running the specified application in Python version 3.9. - This pattern allows for easy testing of endpoints within the context of a larger Flask application without having to start the entire server each time.
