- This function creates a new user and returns their details in JSON format using FastAPI's `@app.post()` decorator with the endpoint "/users/" and specifying the expected request body as an instance of `schemas.UserCreate`. - The function takes two arguments: `user`, which is the data being sent by the client to create a new user, and `db`, which is a database session obtained from the `Depends()` utility function that retrieves it from the `get_db()` function defined elsewhere. - Before creating the new user, this function checks whether there is another user with the same email address using the `crud.get_user_by_email()` helper function. If such a user exists, it raises a `HTTPException` with status code 400 (Bad Request). - Otherwise, the function calls the `crud.create_user()` helper function to insert the new user into the database and return its details.
