- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()` that takes a query parameter `q`.
- The type of `q` is either a string or `None`, and it's required to have a minimum length of 3 characters (using Pydantic's `Query` decorator).
- If `q` is not `None`, it updates a dictionary called `results` with a new key `q` containing its value.
- Finally, the updated `results` dictionary is returned by the function.
