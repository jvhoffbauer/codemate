- Defines a fixture `probe` that returns an instance of FastAPI's EndpointManager (`ep`) with two methods, `probe` and `probe2`, both taking a dependency on `get_jsonrpc_method`. - The `Depends` decorator is used to pass the value returned by `get_jsonrpc_method` as a parameter to these methods at runtime. This allows for dynamic method behavior based on the JSON RPC request being made.
