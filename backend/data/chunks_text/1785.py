- Defines an asynchronous function `info` that takes a dependency on the `Settings` class obtained from the `get_settings()` function using the `Depends` decorator. - Returns a dictionary containing three key-value pairs extracted from the `Settings` object passed to the function. These keys are `"app_name"`, `"admin_email"`, and `"items_per_user"`. The values for these keys come directly from the corresponding attributes of the `Settings` instance.
