- Tests that attempting to PUT a resource with an invalid token results in a forbidden (403) status code and an error message indicating that access is denied due to an incorrect or expired token. - The `test_put_forbidden` function uses the FastAPI testing client to simulate a PUT request on the `/items/{item}` endpoint with a query parameter specifying the item name ("bar") and a custom header containing a fake authentication token ("fake-super-secret-token"). - The expected behavior of this test case is verified by checking the HTTP status code and JSON response body returned by the server using asserts.
