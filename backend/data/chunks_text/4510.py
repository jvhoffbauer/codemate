- This function, `test_root`, is a unit test that uses Flask's built-in testing client to make an HTTP GET request to the root URL ("/"). - The expected status code of the response is checked using the `assert` statement. - If the status code matches what we expect (i.e., 200), then the JSON body of the response is also checked for correctness using another `assert`. In this case, it should be equal to `{"message": "Hello World"}` as defined in our app's main route handler.
