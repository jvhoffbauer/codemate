- Defines a function called `select` with four arguments (`__ent0`, `__ent1`, `entity_2`, and `entity_3`) that are annotated using type hints. The first two arguments have type hints of `_TCCA` for tuple covariant container types containing elements of types `_T0` and `_T1`. - Returns a new object of type `Select` which is a generic class representing a selection operation on multiple entities based on scalar values. This return value has a tuple as its first element consisting of the original input tuples `(_T0,)_` and `(_T1,)_`, followed by the scalar values passed in as arguments `(_TScalar_2,)_` and `(_TScalar_3,)_`.
