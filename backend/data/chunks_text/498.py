- This function tests a specific tutorial (tutorial003 in the offset_and_limit module of the tutorial directory) by using pytest fixtures to clear SQLModel's metadata and replace builtin print statements with a mock object for testing purposes. - The `expected_calls` variable is not defined, so it cannot be determined what exactly this function checks or verifies. However, based on the context, it seems that this function compares the list of printed messages during the execution of the tutorial against an expected set of messages.
