- Defines a function `get_current_active_superuser()` that takes an optional argument `current_user`, which is retrieved using the `Security` wrapper and the `get_current_user()` method from FastAPI's security middleware. - Checks whether the current user has superuser privilege by calling `crud.user.is_superuser()`. If the user is not a superuser, raises a `HTTPException` with a custom error message. - Returns the current user object as it is, since we already checked its permissions in the previous step.
