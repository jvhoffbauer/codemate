- Defines a function `set_null_microseconds` that takes a dictionary `data` as input and returns a new dictionary with modified values. - The function creates an empty dictionary called `datetime_fields`. - It iterates through all keys (`k`) of type `datetime` in the original dictionary `data`, replaces their microsecond value with zero using the `replace()` method, and adds them to the `datetime_fields` dictionary. - Finally, it merges both dictionaries (`data` and `datetime_fields`) into one using the `**` operator and returns the result.
