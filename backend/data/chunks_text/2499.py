- Defines a GET request for the root URL of the application (/) using FastAPI's `@app.get()` decorator. - Includes an optional response definition with status code 500 and model type `NonPydanticModel`. This is used to return custom error messages instead of default ones in case of server errors. - The function body is empty, indicating that this endpoint doesn't perform any action by itself but can be called as part of a larger API design.
