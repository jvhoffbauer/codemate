- This function returns a list of COGs that overlap a specific location given its longitude and latitude coordinates using the `rasterio` library's `assets_for_point()` method.
- The function takes several dependencies including the path to the dataset, the longitude and latitude values, parameters for the backend and reader, and an environment dictionary. These are passed through various dependency functions defined earlier in the class.
- The function uses the `with` statement to create a context manager around the `RasterIO` resources (i.e., the dataset file and its associated metadata). Within this block, it creates a new `Reader` object from the dataset file using the specified reader and backend options, and then calls the `assets_for_point()` method on this reader instance to retrieve the desired list of overlapping assets.
