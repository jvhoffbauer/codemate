- Defines a function `test_openapi_schema` to test the OpenAPI schema of our FastAPI application.
- Makes an HTTP GET request to the `/openapi.json` endpoint using the `client` object provided by PyTest and checks if the status code is 200 (OK). If not, it prints the error message along with the response body.
- Asserts that the JSON response matches the expected structure defined in the `response.json()` method call. The response contains the OpenAPI specification version, API information, paths for endpoints, components containing schemas, etc.
- Verifies that the responses for both endpoints contain appropriate error handling mechanisms such as `JsonApiError` and `Error`. These errors are represented as objects with specific properties like'status' and 'title'.
