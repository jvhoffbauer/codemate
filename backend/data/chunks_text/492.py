- This function tests a specific tutorial (tutorial002 in the offset_and_limit module of the tutorial directory) using pytest fixtures `clear_sqlmodel`, which clears SQLModel's metadata and session, and `get_testing_print_function`, which captures print statements for testing purposes. - The tutorial is executed inside a context manager that patches the built-in `print` function to capture its output in a list called `calls`. - After executing the tutorial, the captured prints are compared against an expected list of prints using the `assert` statement.
