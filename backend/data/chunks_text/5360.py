- Defines a function `main` with an optional argument `algorithm`. If provided, it returns the maximum value of the result obtained by applying the specified algorithm to the input image (stored in variable `img`) using the `data` attribute and converting it to a list for easier handling as JSON response. - Otherwise, it directly returns the maximum value of the input image's data converted to a list. - The `Depends` decorator is used to pass the dependency `algorithms.dependency` to the `algorithm` parameter when it is called from another endpoint that depends on this one. This allows for more complex workflows where multiple algorithms can be applied sequentially or in parallel without duplicating code.
