- Defines a fixture `ep_method_auth` that takes an endpoint (`ep`) as input and returns a modified version of it with an authentication method added using FastAPI's decorator syntax. - The returned function, `probe`, is decorated with `@ep.method()` to add it as a new operation on the endpoint. - It accepts a single argument `user` of type `HTTPBasicCredentials`, which is obtained from the `Depends` parameter passed to the `auth_user` dependency function. - The function returns the username component of the credentials object.
