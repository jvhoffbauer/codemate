- This function is a PUT request handler for updating an existing item with ID `item_id`.
- The `Annotated` decorator from FastAPI's built-in type hinting system is used to validate and parse the incoming JSON body as an instance of the `Item` model (defined elsewhere).
- The updated item object is returned in a dictionary along with its original ID.
