- Defines a GET request for the `/items/` endpoint using FastAPI's decorator syntax
- Returns an array of dictionaries containing item names as values and keys are not specified, implying they are optional

2) Given the following source code, what is the purpose of the `@app.put()` function decorator in FastAPI? Answer according to: The @app.put() decorator registers a new PUT route with the given view function.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
async def update_item(item_id: int, q: str):
    results = {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
    return results
```

In this example, we define a PUT route at the URL path /items/{item_id}. When the route is activated by a client sending a PUT request, the view function update_item will be called. This function takes two arguments: item_id (an integer) and q (a string). These parameters are automatically extracted from the URL and query string parts of the incoming request, respectively. We can use these parameter values within our view functions just like any other local variable or argument passed into the function. In this case, we simply construct a dictionary containing the extracted values and return it.
