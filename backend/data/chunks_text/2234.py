- This function `is_bytes_Sequence_Annotation()` checks if an input type annotation contains sequences of bytes or byte arrays (i.e., bytes literals). - The provided example uses the Union type to create a union between two possible sequence types: list of strings and list of bytes. - While technically allowed by Python's typing module, using unions for mixed byte/string sequences may have limitations and potential issues with handling binary data. It should be used with caution and careful consideration of its intended use case.
