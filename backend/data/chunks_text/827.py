- This function takes a dictionary representing a refresh token from the database and returns a boolean indicating whether it is still valid or not. - The expiration time of the refresh token is retrieved from the "expires_at" key in the dictionary. - The current UTC time is compared to the expiration time using the `datetime.utcnow()` method. If the current time is less than or equal to the expiration time, the refresh token is considered valid; otherwise, it has expired.
