- Defines an asynchronous function `upsert_item` that takes three arguments: `item_id`, `name`, and `size`. The first argument is required while the other two are optional. - If the given `item_id` already exists in a dictionary called `items`, it updates its corresponding values for 'name' and'size'. Otherwise, creates a new dictionary with the provided keys and adds it to the `items` dictionary. - Returns either the updated or newly created item based on whether the `item_id` was found in the `items` dictionary.
