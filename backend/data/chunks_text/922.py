- Defines a function called `decorator` that takes in a decorated callable (a function with decorators applied to it) as an argument and returns it. - Inside the function, adds a new WebSocket route using the `self.add_websocket_route()` method of some object `self`. The path, callback function, and optional name are passed as arguments. - Returns the original decorated callable without any modifications. This allows the decorator to be used like a regular function decorator, but also registers the WebSocket route at the same time.
