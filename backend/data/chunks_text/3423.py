- Tests that passing a non-integer value (in this case, a decimal) for a path parameter with type int raises a validation error with status code 422 and appropriate error message in JSON format using Pytest Flask's `client` object. - The error message includes details about the specific location of the invalid input (the path parameter), the expected data type (an integer), and why the input failed validation (unable to parse a decimal as an integer). - This test uses both the new error handling mechanism introduced in Pydantic v1.8 (IsDict) and the old one (TypeError) which will eventually be removed in future versions of Pydantic.
