- This endpoint allows searching for items using Bleve's Query String syntax. - It supports typeahead searches by allowing wildcard characters (*) in the query string. - The results are limited to a specified number (by default 100) and can be skipped over a certain amount (also by default 0). - Only superusers have access to all search results; regular users can only see their own items.
