- This function resets a password using an existing password reset token and a new password provided by the client. - It takes several arguments including the database session (`db`) obtained from FastAPI's dependency injection system, the password reset token (`token`), and the new password (`new_password`). - The function first verifies the validity of the password reset token using `verify_password_reset_token`. If it fails, a Bad Request error is raised with an appropriate message. - Next, the email associated with the password reset request is retrieved using `crud.user.get_by_email`, which returns the corresponding User object. - If the User object cannot be found or its active flag is false, another error is raised with an appropriate message. - Finally, the hashed version of the new password is set for the User object, and the changes are committed to the database using `db.commit()`. A success message is returned as JSON.
