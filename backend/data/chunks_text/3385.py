- Tests that a GET request to `/path/param-maxlength/{item_id}` with an item ID longer than 3 characters (e.g., 'foobar') returns a 422 Unprocessable Entity status code and a JSON error message containing details about the string length validation failure, including the type of violation ("string_too_long"), location in the URL path ('path', 'item_id'), maximum allowed length (3), input value ('foobar'), contextual information provided by Pydantic's validator ('max_length'), and a URL for further reference on how to handle such errors using pydantic-errors library. - The same functionality is also available as a fallback option for older versions of Pydantic (v1) through a different error format ('value_error.any_str.max_length'). However, it will be removed once support for these outdated versions ends.
