- Defines a function `test_celery_filter_has_uuid_length_attributes()` to test if the `CeleryTracingIdsFilter` class has an attribute for specifying UUID length (set here to 8). - Creates an instance of the `CeleryTracingIdsFilter` with the specified UUID length and asserts that its internal `uuid_length` matches what was passed in.
