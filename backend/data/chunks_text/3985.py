- Defines a fixture named `client` using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called when the fixture is invoked in tests. - Inside the function, we first import the Flask application object (`app`) from the specified tutorial file. - We then create a new instance of the `TestClient` class provided by the `flask_restful` library and pass it our imported `app`. - Finally, we return the newly created `client` object for use in other test functions that invoke this fixture.
