- Defines a function `probe` with two optional arguments `data` and `amount`. If not provided, they will be assigned default values using the `Body()` decorator from Pydantic. The `examples` parameter is used to provide example values for these parameters during testing or documentation generation. - Both `data` and `amount` are marked as required (`...`) but also have additional constraints applied through the `gt` keyword argument of `Body()`. This ensures that their values meet certain criteria before being passed into the function body. - Finally, both arguments are deleted from the local scope using the Python built-in `del` statement since they're no longer needed in this context.
