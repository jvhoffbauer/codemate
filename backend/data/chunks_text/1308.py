- This function is a Pydantic FastAPI route with an `@app.post` decorator and a path of `"/files/"`.
- It takes a single argument, `file`, which can be either a byte string (`bytes`) or `None` represented by the `File` class from Pydantic's built-in `FastAPI` schema. If no file is provided, it defaults to `None`.
- The function returns a dictionary containing two key-value pairs: `{"message"` and `"No file sent"}` if no file was sent, or `{"file_size"` and the length of the received file in bytes otherwise.
