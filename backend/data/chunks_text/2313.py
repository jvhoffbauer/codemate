- This method `__dict__` is called when trying to access an object's attributes using the `vars()` function or dictionary unpacking (e.g., `**obj`) in Python. - If the object doesn't have a real `__dict__`, it raises a `TypeError` with the given message, which matches the behavior of `asyncpg.pgroto.pgproto.UUID`. - In other words, this method provides a way for objects without a real `__dict__` to still behave as if they had one, preventing unexpected errors during variable assignment and function calls that rely on keyword arguments.
