- Defines a fixture named `client` using pytest's built-in `fixture()` decorator with the name argument set to "client". - The function `get_client()` is defined as the implementation of this fixture, which returns an instance of FlaskTestClient (from Flask's testing module). - This instance represents a test client that can be used to make requests against our application and assert responses. - We first import the `app` object created in tutorial010.py, which we will use to create the test client.
