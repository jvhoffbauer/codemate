- This function takes three arguments: `route`, which is an instance of Flask's APIRoute class; `method`, a string representing the HTTP request method (e.g., 'GET', 'POST'); and `operation_ids`, a set to keep track of unique operation IDs.
- It initializes an empty dictionary called `operation`.
- If the `route` object has any tags associated with it, they are added to the `operation` dictionary under the key 'tags'.
- The summary of the operation is generated using another helper function `generate_operation_summary()` and stored in the `operation` dictionary under the key'summary'.
- If there is a description provided for this endpoint, it is also added to the `operation` dictionary under the key 'description'.
- An operation ID is either taken from the `route` object itself or calculated based on its unique identifier. This value is then checked against the existing list of operation IDs to ensure uniqueness. A warning is issued if duplicates are found.
- Finally, the operation ID is added to the `operation` dictionary under the key 'operationId'.
- If the `route` object is marked as deprecated, that information is included in the `operation` dictionary under the key 'deprecated'.
