- This function registers a new user using the `service.create_user()` method and returns their email address in a dictionary format.
- The `AuthUser` parameter is used to validate the user data before creating it with the `Depends()` decorator from FastAPI's dependency injection system (valid_user_create).
- The returned dictionary contains just the email of the newly created user for simplicity but could include other relevant information as well.
