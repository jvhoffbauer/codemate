- This function handles a POST request to `/upload/file`, which is used for uploading images. - The `UploadFile` parameter from FastAPI's built-in `File` class is used to receive and process the image data. - A local storage solution (temporarily) is implemented by saving files in a directory named "static/img". In production environments, cloud storage services like OSS should be utilized instead. - To avoid duplicate storage of identical resources, it's recommended to calculate and record an MD5 value once. - Finally, the response object is returned containing the URL path to the saved image.
