- Defines a function called `decorator` that takes in a decorated callable (a function with decorators applied to it). - Returns the same decorated callable after adding API route information using the `self.add_api_route()` method of an object named `self`. - Passes various arguments to the `self.add_api_route()` method, including the original endpoint URL (`path`), the decorated callable itself (as the handler for this endpoint), and additional metadata such as HTTP status codes, OpenAPI schema definitions, and other options related to documentation and routing behavior.
