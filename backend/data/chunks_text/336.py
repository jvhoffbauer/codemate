- Checks whether the current environment is MkDocs Insiders using `is_mkdocs_insiders()`. If so, sets an environmental variable to point to a custom configuration file for this version of MkDocs (`./mkdocs.insiders.yml`). - Sets an environmental variable for macOS systems that have Homebrew installed and are running MkDocs Insiders or Cairo. This allows Django to find required libraries in the correct location during startup.
