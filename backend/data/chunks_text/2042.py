- This function is a plugin that modifies Markdown content during document generation using MkDocs. - It checks whether the current page's file is an `EnFile`, which represents English language files. - If so, it iterates over a list of directories to exclude from translation (stored in `non_traslated_sections`) and returns the original Markdown content if the directory matches any of them. - Otherwise, it retrieves the content of missing translations from a specified location (`config.docs_dir`) and adds it as a header followed by the original Markdown content.
