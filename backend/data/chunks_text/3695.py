- Tests that making a GET request to the root URL without passing any query parameters results in a HTTP status code of 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and an error message indicating that the 'token' field is missing from the query parameters. - The error message conforms to the JSON API specification for validation errors with a detailed description of the issue and its location within the request body or headers. - This test ensures that our application adheres to RESTful principles by returning clear and concise error messages instead of generic ones like "Bad Request" or "Internal Server Error".
