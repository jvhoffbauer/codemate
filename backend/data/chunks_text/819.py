- This function authenticates a user using `service.authenticate_user()`.
- If authentication is successful, it creates a new refresh token for the authenticated user and sets its value as a cookie in the HTTP response.
- It returns an object containing both the newly generated access token (using FastAPI's built-in JWT functionality) and the previously created refresh token.
