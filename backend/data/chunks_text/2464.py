- Defines a dataclass called `Item` with three attributes: `name`, `price`, and `owner_ids`. - The `price` attribute is optional, as indicated by the use of the `Optional` type hint from the standard library's typing module. - The `owner_ids` attribute is also optional, but its default value is an empty list instead of `None`. This allows us to initialize new items without specifying any owners right away, while still having a place to store their IDs later on if needed.
