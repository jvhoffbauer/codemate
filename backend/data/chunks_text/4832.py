- This endpoint retrieves a list of all available role enums using `crud.utils.ensure_enums_to_strs()`.
- The result is returned as a JSON object with a "roles" key containing an array of string representations of each enum value.
- Access to this endpoint requires authentication and authorization as the current user must be a superuser (`Depends(get_current_active_superuser)`).
