- Defines a function `simple_include()` that returns an instance of `Model2`, which contains a nested instance of `Model1`. - The values for `Model1`'s attributes are hardcoded directly in the function body, rather than being passed as arguments or retrieved from external sources. - This pattern is called "simple include" because it allows you to easily embed one object inside another without having to worry about complex dependencies or configuration logic. It can be useful for creating hierarchical data structures with fixed relationships between objects.
