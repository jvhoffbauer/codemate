- Attempts to create a SQLAlchemy column for an optional integer field in a SQLModel subclass called `Item`.
- Sets the column as both the primary key and uniquely identifiable using the `UniqueConstraint` decorator from SQLAlchemy's `sqlalchemy_utils` extension.
- Raises a `RuntimeError` because setting both `primary_key` and `unique` on the same column is not allowed by SQLAlchemy.
