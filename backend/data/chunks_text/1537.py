- Defines a GET request for `"/items/"`, which returns JSON data based on query parameters passed in the URL.
- Includes an optional query parameter named `hidden_query`. This parameter is not included in the schema by default (`include_in_schema=False`) but can still be accessed using the `Annotated` decorator from Pydantic's `models` module.
- If the `hidden_query` parameter is present, it is returned as part of the response body; otherwise, a hardcoded value is returned instead.
