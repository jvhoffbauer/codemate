- This function, `test_celery_asyncio_io_bound`, calls the asynchronous version of Celery's task decorator (`async_to_sync`) to execute a specific task called `task_io_bound`. - The `task_io_bound` is an I/O bound task that performs some input and output operations using Python's built-in `os` module. By executing this task asynchronously with Celery's AsyncIO support, we can improve its concurrency and reduce resource contention during execution.
