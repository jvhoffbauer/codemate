- Creates a mock uploaded file with contents "data" using `io.BytesIO`.
- Asserts that reading from the file returns its original content ("data").
- Writes additional bytes to the file and asserts that reading it again returns an empty byte string (the new bytes have not been written yet).
- Appends some more data to the end of the file and reads it back completely.
- Seeks back to the beginning of the file and reads it again to confirm all changes were saved correctly.
- Closes the file to release any resources being held by it.
