- This method is an asynchronous function called `_call`. It takes three arguments - `admin`, `request`, and `sel`.
- The purpose of this method is to filter a query based on the values specified in the `values` attribute of the `SelectFilter` class.
- If there are no values provided, it returns the original select statement (`sel`) without any filters.
- Otherwise, it retrieves the column specified by the `column` attribute from the model defined by the `ModelAdmin` object passed as an argument.
- Depending on whether there's exactly one value or multiple values in `values`, it applies either an equality or IN clause to the WHERE condition of the SQL query represented by `sel`.
