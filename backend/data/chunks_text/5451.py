- Defines a custom file backend `CustomFileBackend`, which extends the built-in `FileBackend`. - Adds two optional attributes `minzoom` and `maxzoom` with default values of `None`. - In the post-initialization method `__attrs_post_init__`, reads the mosaic definition (if it wasn't provided during initialization) and sets the `minzoom` and `maxzoom` based on that value. This allows for more flexible configuration options when using this custom backend.
