- Defines an asynchronous function called `overrider_sub_dependency` that takes a single argument, `k`, which is assumed to be a string key. - The function returns a dictionary with a single item, where the key is the input `k`. This suggests that this function may be used in some sort of dependency injection or configuration system, potentially allowing for customization or override of specific values at runtime based on certain conditions or inputs.
