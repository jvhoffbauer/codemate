- Generates an OpenAPI v3.1 JSON schema for a FastAPI application
- Includes information about the API's title and version (in this case, 'FastAPI' and '0.1.0')
- Defines paths for multiple endpoints ('/a', '/b', etc.) with corresponding HTTP methods (GET) and responses (success or error messages)
- Uses summary and operationID fields to provide additional context and documentation for each endpoint
- Provides examples of how to handle different types of errors (e.g., status codes 400, 501, etc.)
- Allows for customization of response content using the 'Content-Type' header (here, 'application/json')
- Supports nested schemas through use of '$ref' references within components section
