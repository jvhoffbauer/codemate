- Defines a function `get_client()` that returns an instance of Flask's built-in test client, `TestClient`, for interacting with our application's endpoints without actually making network requests or starting a server. - Imports the necessary components from our project structure (docs_src and tutorial005_py310). - Uses the `with` statement to create a context manager around the `app` object, which is defined in the imported module. This ensures that any resources associated with the app are properly cleaned up after use. By returning this client object, we can easily make requests against our API using the methods provided by the `TestClient` class, such as `get()`, `post()`, etc., without having to worry about setting up a full HTTP request/response cycle.
