- This function takes three arguments: `owner`, which represents the parent component of the child being renamed; `child`, which is the specific child component to be renamed; and `postfix`, a string that will be appended to the end of the child's name in order to distinguish it from other components with similar names within its scope (i.e., the same parent). - The function first checks whether the given child component is indeed a child of the specified owner using the `is_scope_child()` helper function. If so, it creates a new component object by calling the `component_name()` factory method with an updated name for the child, where the updated name includes both the original name of the child and the provided postfix separated by a period. - Finally, the function returns the newly created component object instead of the original one, effectively renaming the child component as desired.
