- Defines a fixture named `superuser_token_headers`, scoped to the module level (i.e., available for all tests in this file). - Uses the `get_superuser_token_headers()` function from another part of the application to retrieve an authentication token and headers for a superuser user. - Returns the resulting dictionary containing the necessary authorization information as the value of the fixture.
