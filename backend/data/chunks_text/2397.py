- Defines an asynchronous function `get_state()` that returns the current application state (represented by a variable called `state`) without modifying it. - The function is marked asynchronous using the `async` keyword, indicating that it may contain await expressions and be used in async contexts such as coroutines or tasks. - This function can be useful for reading the current state of the application from other parts of the program without having to pass around complex objects or perform expensive computations.
