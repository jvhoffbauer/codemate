- Defines a method `get_resp` that returns a dictionary representing an API response with error information and optional data. - The `error` dictionary contains the HTTP status code (`CODE`) and message (`MESSAGE`) of the error. - If there is any response data available from the underlying API call, it's added to the `error` dictionary under the key 'data'. - Finally, the resulting JSON-RPC response object is constructed using the `jsonable_encoder` function provided by FastAPI.
