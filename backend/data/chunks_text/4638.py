- Defines a fixture named `client` using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called by PyTest when it encounters this fixture in tests that use it. - Inside the function, we first import the Flask application object (`app`) from the specified tutorial file. - We then create a new instance of Flask's built-in test client (`TestClient`) with our imported `app`. - Finally, we return the newly created `TestClient` instance for use in other functions or classes within our testing suite.
