- Defines a new endpoint `/subrouter` using FastAPI's decorator syntax for subrouters. - Specifies that the response model is a list of `Item` objects and handles a 404 error by returning a list of `Message` objects as part of the response schema. - Accepts two arguments named `item1` and `item2`, both of type `Item`. The function returns both items without any further processing or validation (covered in next example).
