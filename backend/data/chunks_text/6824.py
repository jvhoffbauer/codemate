- This function is called `login_access_token`, and it's responsible for generating a new access token when a user logs in using their email and password. - It takes two dependencies as arguments: `Session` from SQLAlchemy (which we use to interact with our database) and `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm` which is provided by FastAPI Security to handle authentication forms. - The function first retrieves the user object from the database based on the given email and password using the `crud.user.authenticate` method. If the user doesn't exist or has been deactivated, it raises an error. - After successfully authenticating the user, the function creates a new access token using the `security.create_access_token` helper function. The ID of the authenticated user is passed as an argument along with the expiration time specified in the settings file. - Finally, the function returns a dictionary containing both the generated access token and its type ("Bearer").
