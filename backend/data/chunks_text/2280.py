- Defines a function `get_validdict()` that returns a dictionary with three keys ("k1", "k2", and "k3") containing objects of type `Item`. - The `Item` class is not defined in this snippet but it's assumed to have an attribute called `aliased_name`. - The first two items (with keys "k1" and "k2") are initialized without specifying their `price`, which will be excluded from the resulting dictionary using the `ExcludeUnset` rule. - The third item (with key "k3") has both its `price` and `owner_ids` specified, so they won't be excluded by default.
