- Defines a fixture named `client` using pytest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called by pytest when it encounters this fixture in tests that use it. - Inside the `get_function()`, we first import the Flask application object (`app`) from a specific module (`docs_src.extra_data_types.tutorial001_an_py310`). - We then create a new instance of FlaskTestClient and pass our imported `app` as an argument. This creates a test client for interacting with our Flask application during testing. - Finally, we return the created test client so that other functions can access it via dependency injection or fixtures.
