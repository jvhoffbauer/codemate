- Includes both GET and POST methods for retrieving statistics.
- Uses FastAPI dependencies (such as `path_dependency`, `layer_dependency`, etc.) to pass parameters to the underlying functions that calculate statistics.
- Returns either plain JSON or GeoJSON depending on whether the request body is empty or contains a GeoJSON object respectively.
