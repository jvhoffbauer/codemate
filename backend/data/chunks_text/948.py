- This method generates a hash value based on the identity of the `ModelField`.
- The hash value can be used as a key in a dictionary mapping `ModelFields` to their corresponding JSON schemas.
- By using the field's identity as the hash value, we ensure that each `ModelField` has a unique representation in the dictionary.
