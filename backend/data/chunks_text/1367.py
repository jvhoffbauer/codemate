- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()` that takes a positional argument `strange_header`.
- The type of `strange_header` is either a string or `Header`, which has two optional arguments - `default` and `convert_underscores`. If `strange_header` is not provided, it defaults to `None`.
- When `strange_header` is passed in, its value will be converted using `convert_underscores` (which is set to False by default). This means that underscore characters are preserved instead of being replaced with spaces like they would be when converting between snake case and camelCase.
- Inside the function, a dictionary called `result` is returned containing a key named `strange_header` whose value is the same as what was passed into the function for this parameter.
