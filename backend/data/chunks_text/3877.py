- Defines a fixture named `client` using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called when the fixture is invoked in tests. - Inside the fixture definition, we first import the Flask application object (`app`) from our module `docs_src/body_multiple_params/tutorial001_an`. - We then create an instance of the `TestClient` class provided by Flask's testing utility and pass it the imported `app` as an argument. - Finally, we return the created `TestClient` instance so that it can be used in test functions that invoke this fixture.
