- Defines a fixture named `user_client` with session scope using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - Takes an argument `user`, which is assumed to be a `User` object from another part of the test suite or application. - Returns an instance of `ApiClient` initialized with the Flask app and the provided `User`. This fixture can then be used in tests that require authenticated API access for the given user.
