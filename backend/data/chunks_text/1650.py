- Defines an asynchronous function `read_users` that takes a default argument `commons`, which is obtained using the `Depends()` decorator and passed to it the dictionary returned by the `common_parameters` function. - The function returns the value of the `commons` parameter, which contains common parameters for multiple endpoints in the application. This allows reusing these parameters instead of passing them separately to each endpoint.
