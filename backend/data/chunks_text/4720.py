- This test uses `pytest`, `fastapi`, and `uvicorn` to create a RESTful API that allows users to upload multiple files at once using multipart requests. - The `needs_py39` decorator is used to ensure that Python version 3.9 or higher is required for this test. - Two temporary files are created in the `tmp_path` directory provided by pytest's `tempdirfixture`. These files contain sample data for testing purposes. - A `TestClient` object from fastapi's built-in testing library is created to simulate HTTP requests against our api. - We make a POST request to the `/uploadfiles/` endpoint, passing two files (`test.txt` and `test2.txt`) in the `files` parameter of the request body. - After making the request, we check the status code and text of the response to verify that everything worked correctly. - Finally, we extract the list of filenames returned by the server and compare it to what we expect based on the names of the files we passed in the request.
