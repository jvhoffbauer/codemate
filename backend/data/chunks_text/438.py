- This test case is part of a tutorial in SQLAlchemy's documentation and tests the `select_heroes()`, `create_table()`, and `drop_tables()` functions defined in module `docs_src.tutorial.one.tutorial005`. - It uses fixtures to set up an engine and session, and raises an exception when trying to run the main function without creating tables first. - The test creates a new print function using `get_testing_print_function()` and patches it to capture output during the call to `select_heroes()`. - Finally, it checks that the captured output matches the expected result.
