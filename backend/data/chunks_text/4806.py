- Takes a list of search results from Couchbase as input and converts them into instances of a Pydantic model. - The function iterates over each document in the search results and extracts its fields using `doc['fields']`. - If any field is missing or null, it skips that document and moves on to the next one. - For non-null values, the function checks whether they have an appropriate shape (list, set, tuple) based on the corresponding field's shape defined in the Pydantic model. - If necessary, it wraps scalar values inside lists before passing them to the constructor of the Pydantic model instance. - Finally, the function returns a list containing all the converted documents.
