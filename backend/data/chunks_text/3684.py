- This test checks if a request with `"monica"` as the access token returns an error message when trying to retrieve users without including the `"jessica"` access token, which is required for this operation according to some business logic or security policy. - The `@needs_py39` decorator indicates that Python version 3.9 or higher is needed to run this test case. - The `TestClient` class from FastAPI's testing module is used to create a new instance of the application and simulate HTTP requests against it.
