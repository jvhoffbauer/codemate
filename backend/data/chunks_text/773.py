- Defines an `async` function called `fetch_one` that takes a SQL query (either SELECT, INSERT or UPDATE) as its argument and returns either a dictionary representing a single row from the result set or `None`. - Uses the `engine` object to create a connection using the `begin()` method of the AsyncEngineConnection class. - Executes the given SQL statement using the `await` keyword and stores it in a variable named `cursor`. - Retrieves the first row from the result set using the `first()` method of the CursorResult object and converts it into a dictionary using the `_asdict()` method. If there are no rows returned by the query, `None` is returned instead.
