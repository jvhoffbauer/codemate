- Defines a class method `find_or_404` for the current model (accessed through `self`) using Django's built-in decorator `@classmethod`.
- Takes keyword arguments as input and filters the corresponding objects from the database using `filter()`.
- Returns either the first object found by the filter or raises a HTTP 404 error if no matching object is found using Django's `get_object_or_404()` function.
