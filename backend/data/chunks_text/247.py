- Defines a function `update_team` that takes three arguments: a SQLAlchemy session (retrieved using `Depends` and `get_session`), the ID of the team to be updated, and an object representing the new data for the team (also called `team`)
- Retrieves the existing team from the database using its ID
- Raises a `HTTPException` with status code 404 if the team is not found
- Merges the new data into the existing team's attributes using Python's built-in `__dict__` functionality
- Adds the modified team back to the session and commits the changes
- Refreshes the session to ensure any related objects are also loaded
- Returns the updated team
