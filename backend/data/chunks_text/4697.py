- This test checks if a POST request with an empty JSON body returns a 422 Unprocessable Entity status code and a detailed error message from Pydantic's validation errors. - The `IsDict` type hint is used to ensure that the response JSON is indeed a dictionary containing the expected error details. - Two different versions of the error message are tested for compatibility with both current (Pydantic v1) and future (Pydantic v2) releases.
