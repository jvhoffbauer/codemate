- Defines a method `get_route_handler` that returns a callable function (a route handler).
- Saves the original route handler from the parent class using `super().get_route_handler()`.
- Creates an asynchronous function called `custom_route_handler` which takes a request object and returns a response object.
- Measures the execution time of the original route handler by saving the current time in `before`, executing it, and calculating the difference with `duration`.
- Adds a new header to the response object containing the calculated duration.
- Prints some debug information about the route's performance.
- Returns the modified response object.
