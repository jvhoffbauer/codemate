- Defines a function called `decorator` that takes in either a function or coroutine as an argument (`func`) and returns a callable object. - Inside the function, it calls another method of the class (presumably `self`, which is not shown here) called `add_method_route`. This method adds the given function/coroutine to some sort of route table based on keyword arguments passed to the decorator (stored in `**kwargs`). - The decorated function/coroutine is then returned unchanged by the decorator.
