- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items` that takes a single argument `commons`, which is annotated with both `dict` and `Depends(common_parameters)`. - The `Depends()` decorator retrieves the value of the `common_parameters` dependency from the request scope and passes it to the `read_items()` function as the `commons` parameter. - This function returns the `commons` dictionary without modifying its contents.
