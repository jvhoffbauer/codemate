- Initializes `TableView` with optional `TableModel` subclass and list of SQLAlchemy `Column` objects as `fields`. If neither are provided, defaults to using the current instance's `model` and all columns except excluded ones. - Checks that `model` exists and has a primary key column. - Creates parser for converting between SQLAlchemy models and JSON/Python dictionaries. - Filters out excluded columns from `fields`, then adds PK column unless already included. - Sets default values for `list_filter` and `link_models`.
