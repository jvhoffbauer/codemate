- Tests the security of HTTP requests by making a GET request to "/users/me" with an invalid authorization header ("Other foobar") using Flask's built-in `client`. - Asserts that the server returns a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) and displays an error message in the text body if the authorization header is incorrect or missing. - If the authorization header is valid, asserts that the JSON response contains the correct scheme and credentials values specified in the application configuration file.
