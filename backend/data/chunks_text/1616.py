- This function is a FastAPI route with GET method and path `"/items/"`.
- It uses the `Depends()` decorator to pass an argument `query_or_default` that can be either retrieved from the URL query string or cookie using the `query_or_cookie_extractor` dependency provided by FastAPI's built-in middleware.
- The function returns a dictionary containing the value of `query_or_default`, which could have been obtained from either the query string or cookie depending on its availability.
