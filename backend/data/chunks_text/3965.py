- This function is a parameterized test using PyTest's `parametrize` decorator to run two tests with different values for the 'compress' argument. - The 'n', 'headers', and 'body' variables are initialized with default values. - If 'compress' is True, the 'data' variable is compressed using GZIP compression and the 'Content-Encoding' header is set accordingly in the 'headers' dictionary. - Regardless of whether 'compress' is True or False, the 'Content-Type' header is always set to 'application/json'. - After making an HTTP POST request to '/sum' endpoint with the appropriate headers and data, the JSON response from the server is checked against expected output.
