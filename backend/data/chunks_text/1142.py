- This function named `get_current_user()` takes a token as an argument and returns the decoded user information using the `fake_decode_token()` helper function provided by FastAPI's built-in OAuth2 authentication scheme, which is accessed through the `Depends()` decorator. - The returned value of this function can be used to securely pass user data between different endpoints without having to reauthenticate or send the token with every request.
