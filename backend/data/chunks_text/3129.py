- This endpoint returns a list of `Item` objects in JSON format using FastAPI's built-in `response_model`.
- The returned items have properties for name, date (as datetime object), and optionally price and an array of owner IDs.
- The example implementation creates three dummy items with fixed values for testing purposes.
