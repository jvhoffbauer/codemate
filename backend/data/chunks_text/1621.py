- Defines an asynchronous function `read_users` that takes a `CommonsDep` object (a dependency injection container) as its argument. - The function returns the entire contents of the `CommonsDep` object, which presumably contains some data related to users or user management. This is likely used in other parts of the application for various purposes such as authentication, authorization, and accessing user information.
