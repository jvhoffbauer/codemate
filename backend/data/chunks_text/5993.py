- Defines a hybrid property called `content_text` for the current class (presumably a model) using the `@hybrid_property` decorator from SQLAlchemy's declarative base. - The value of this property is determined by accessing the `content` attribute of the object, and returning its `content` attribute if it exists, or `None` otherwise. This allows us to easily retrieve the textual content of an object without having to perform additional checks on whether the `content` attribute exists first.
