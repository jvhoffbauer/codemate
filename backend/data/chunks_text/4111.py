- This function uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` to define multiple tests with different input values for the URL path (`path`), request headers (`headers`), expected HTTP status code (`expected_status`), and expected JSON response body (`expected_response`) from a GET request using FastAPI's built-in `TestClient`. - The first test case sends no headers and expects a successful response with the default user agent string set by FastAPI. - The second test case sets an invalid header key ("X-Header") but still expects a successful response with the default user agent string set by FastAPI. - The third test case explicitly sets the user agent header value to "FastAPI test" and expects that same value in the server's response headers.
