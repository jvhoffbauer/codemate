- Defines a custom `UserAdmin` for the `User` model using FastAPI's built-in admin interface (Starlette).
- Adds two filters to the list view: one based on the primary key and another labeling the username as 'name'.
- Registers the router with the admin site and retrieves the resulting instance of the user admin.
- Asserts that the expected fields are present in both the filter schema and the generated OpenAPI specification.
