- This is a unit test for `docs_src/tutorial/where.py`, specifically for the `test_tutorial` function.
- It imports and uses functions from the `unittest` module to set up and run the test.
- The `@pytest.fixture` decorator creates a fixture called `clear_sqlmodel` that clears SQLModel's metadata before each test case.
- The `get_testing_print_function` function is used to capture print statements during the execution of the tested function (in this case, `mod.main()`) and store them in a list called `calls`.
- The `patch` context manager replaces Python's built-in `print` function with our custom one (the `new_print` variable).
- Finally, we call `mod.main()` inside the patched environment and check if the captured output matches what we expect it to be.
