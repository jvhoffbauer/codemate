- Defines a new endpoint `/middleware` using FastAPI's router decorator
- Accepts an uploaded file with the name `file`, which is bound to a Pydantic model called `File`. This model has a default value of `None` and a required parameter named `description` that must be passed when invoking this function. The `description` field specifies a human-readable label for the file being uploaded, such as "Big File". By binding the request body to a Pydantic model like `File`, we can validate user input against our schema before processing it further in our application logic. In this case, we are validating that the file exists (i.e., was included in the HTTP request) and that its `description` matches what we expect. If these conditions aren't met, FastAPI will raise a validation error instead of executing the rest of the function. - Returns a simple JSON response containing a success message
