- Generates an OpenAPI (Swagger) JSON schema for a FastAPI application using Pytest and Python 3.10 or higher. - The `test_openapi_schema` function tests that the generated schema is correct by making a GET request to the `/openapi.json` endpoint of the FastAPI app and checking its status code and content against expected values. - The schema includes definitions for the main components of the API, such as paths, responses, parameters, headers, schemas, and error types. - The schema uses the latest version of OpenAPI (v3.1.0), which supports features like server variables, custom media types, and more.
