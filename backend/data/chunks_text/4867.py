- This function is called `recover_password` and takes a `str` argument named `username`. It's responsible for handling password recovery requests. - The function first retrieves the default GCP Storage Bucket using `google.cloud.storage.Client().get_default_bucket()`. - Next, it uses the CRUD operations to retrieve the user from the bucket based on their provided `username`. If the user doesn't exist, an error message is raised. - After obtaining the user object, the function generates a new password reset token using `generate_password_reset_token()`, which we assume is defined elsewhere. - Finally, the function sends a password reset email to the user's email address (which was also obtained during the previous step). We assume that there's another helper function called `send_reset_password_email()` that handles sending emails.
