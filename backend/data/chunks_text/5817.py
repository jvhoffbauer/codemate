- This function `get_model_admin` uses a decorator `@lru_cache()` to implement caching of previously computed results using least recently used (LRU) algorithm. - The function takes a `str` argument `table_name`, which represents the name of the database table whose associated model's admin object needs to be retrieved or created. - If an admin class inheriting from either `ModelAdmin` or `AdminApp` is found with its bound model matching the given `table_name`, it returns that admin instance. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself on each registered app's `AdminApp` instance until an appropriate admin is found. - If none are found, it returns `None`.
