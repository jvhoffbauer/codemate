- `get_locations()` function returns a dictionary containing parsed New York Times (NYT) data about COVID-19 cases by U.S. County. It checks a shared cache first before making an API call. If the cache is empty, it makes the API call, parses the CSV, groups the locations based on their counties, creates a history for each location's confirmed and death counts, normalizes the items into `NYTLocation` objects, saves them to a local cache, and finally returns the resulting list. - This function uses the `logging` module to log informational messages at different stages of execution. - The `httputils` module is used to make HTTP requests via the `aiohttp` library. - The `jsonpickle` package is used to serialize/deserialize Python objects to JSON format. - The `redis` package is used to store the data locally in Redis cache.
