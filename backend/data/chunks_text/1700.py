- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()` that takes two arguments: `item_id`, a required integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and `q`, an optional string query parameter. - The `Path` decorator is used on the `item_id` argument to add validation constraints such as minimum value (gt), maximum value (le), and descriptive title for documentation purposes. - The resulting dictionary with keys 'item_id' and 'q' (if provided) is returned by the function.
