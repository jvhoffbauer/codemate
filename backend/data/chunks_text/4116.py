- Defines a fixture named `client` using pytest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called by PyTest before each test that uses it. - Inside the function, we first import the necessary module (`docs_src.header_params.tutorial002_an_py310`) and then create an instance of Flask's `TestClient`. - Finally, we return the created `TestClient` object so that it can be used in tests as needed.
