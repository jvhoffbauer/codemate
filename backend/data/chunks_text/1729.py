- This endpoint is triggered when a POST request is made with an email address in the URL path (`/send-notification/{email}`). - The `background_tasks` object from FastAPI's built-in background tasks feature is used to schedule a task for asynchronous execution using the `add_task()` method. - The scheduled task writes a log message containing the email recipient and a customized message to a file or database using the `write_log()` function defined elsewhere in the application. - A JSON response indicating that the notification has been successfully sent is returned immediately to the client.
