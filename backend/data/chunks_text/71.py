- This method is called after initializing a `FieldInfo` object and before it's used in other parts of the program.
- It calls the private method `_validate()` on the `FieldInfo` instance to perform validation checks on its properties, which are defined by the user when creating the `FieldInfo`.
- The `type: ignore[attr-defined]` annotation is needed because mypy (a static type checker for Python) raises an error due to the fact that `_validate()` is not explicitly declared as a public attribute of `FieldInfo`, but rather implemented internally within the class. By adding this annotation, we tell mypy to ignore this warning and continue with the execution of the code without raising any errors or warnings related to this specific case.
