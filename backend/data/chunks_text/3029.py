- Override `common_parameters` dependency with a custom implementation that returns different values for `"k"` and `"baz"` parameters using `sub_router_decorator`.
- Make an HTTP GET request to the decorated route with `"k"` parameter set to `"bar"`.
- Verify that the expected response is returned, indicating successful execution of the decorated function.
- Clear the override dictionary after testing to restore original dependencies.
