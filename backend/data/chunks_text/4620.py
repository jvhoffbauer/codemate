- Imports `fake_users_db` and `verify_password` functions from a tutorial on password hashing using Python 3.9's built-in hashlib module. - Asserts that `verify_password()` function returns true when passed "secret" as plaintext password and the hashed password of user "johndoe". This is a unit test to ensure correctness of the password verification functionality in the tutorial example.
