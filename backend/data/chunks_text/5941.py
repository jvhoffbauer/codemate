- Adds a dictionary of translation objects to an internal `dict` called `_locales`. - For each key (i.e., language) and value (i.e., translation object) pair in the input dictionary `translations`, it checks whether the language is already present as a key in `_locales`. If so, it adds the translation object to the list associated with that language; otherwise, it creates a new list containing just the current translation object.
