- Defines a function `get_path_param_id` that takes an optional parameter `item_id`, which is annotated as a string and defaulted to be obtained from the path using Pydantic's `Path` class. - The function returns the value of `item_id`. This can be used in API endpoints to extract ID parameters directly from URL paths, without having to parse them manually or rely on query strings.
