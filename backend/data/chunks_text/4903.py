- Defines a fixture named `server_api` with module scope using the `pytest.fixture` decorator. - Returns the result of calling the `get_server_api()` function, which is assumed to be responsible for creating or configuring an API client for interacting with a server. - This fixture can be used in multiple tests within the same Python file (i.e., module) without needing to redefine it each time.
