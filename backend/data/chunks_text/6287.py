- This function is a parameterized test using PyTest's `parametrize` decorator with IO parameters (file path, filename, contents). - It creates a temporary directory and file using Python's built-in `tempfile` module to store the output of the `app.io.save` method. - The function asserts that the created file doesn't exist before calling `app.io.save`, passing it the temporary file path, input content, and any additional keyword arguments provided by the parametrization. - After saving, the function checks if the saved file exists and returns its path.
