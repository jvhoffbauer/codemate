- Defines a class method called `__get_pydantic_json_schema__` that takes two arguments (`core_schema` and `handler`) from Pydantic's JSON schema generation process. - Returns a dictionary representing the JSON Schema for this specific field type ("type" = string, "format" = binary). This ensures that when converting an instance of this model to JSON or YAML format using Pydantic's serialization features, it will be serialized as base64 encoded bytes instead of a human-readable representation.
