- Generates an OpenAPI v3.1.0 schema for a FastAPI application using `fastapi.testclient`.
- Verifies that the GET request to `/openapi.json` returns a successful HTTP status code and contains the expected JSON schema with definitions for endpoints, components (such as schemas), and other metadata.
- Specifically checks that the schema includes details about the `GET /items/` endpoint's responses, summary, operation ID, and required properties for the `Item` schema used in requests and responses related to items.
