- Defines a function `start_app_handler` that takes an instance of `FastAPI` as input and returns another callable function. - The inner function `startup` is defined inside `start_app_handler`. It doesn't take any arguments but returns nothing (i.e., it's a void function). - Inside `startup`, we log a message using the `logger` object, which seems to be imported from some external library or module. We assume this logging functionality helps us keep track of application events for debugging purposes. - Finally, we invoke a helper function called `_startup_model` with the `FastAPI` instance passed in by the caller. This step might involve initializing models, loading data into memory, or performing other setup tasks required before serving requests.
