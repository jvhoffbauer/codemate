- Defines a function `test_sa_column_no_primary_key` that raises a `RuntimeError`.
- Creates a new SQLAlchemy model called `Item`, inheriting from both SQLModel and having a custom Table object created using the `table` parameter of SQLModel.
- The `id` field is defined as an optional integer with a default value of `None`, which will be used to generate the primary key for each instance of this model. This field has two different definitions - one using the built-in `Field` decorator provided by SQLModel, and another using the `Column` decorator provided by SQLAlchemy itself. Both definitions set the `primary_key` flag to True, but this causes a conflict since SQLAlchemy expects exactly one column to have this attribute per table. Therefore, raising a `RuntimeError` is necessary in order to prevent such conflicts during runtime.
