- This function takes a type `t` as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether it's a union type (i.e., either `UnionType` or `Union`) in MyPy. - The function checks if the input type `t` is equal to `UnionType` or `Union`, which are built-in types for representing unions of multiple types in MyPy. - If `t` matches any of these conditions, the function returns True; otherwise, False.
