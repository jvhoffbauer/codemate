- This function takes a `HTTPBasicCredentials` object as an optional argument and returns a dictionary containing the username and password from that object if provided. - The `Depends()` decorator is used to pass the authentication information obtained through FastAPI's built-in security middleware (e.g., OAuth2 or JWT) into this function. - If no authentication information is passed in, the function simply returns an empty dictionary with no keys.
