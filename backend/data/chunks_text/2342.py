- Generates an OpenAPI schema for a FastAPI application using `client.get("/openapi.json")`.
- Asserts that the status code is 200 and checks the text content if necessary.
- Verifies that the JSON response matches the expected structure with specific keys such as 'openapi', 'info', 'paths', and 'components'.
- Confirms that the 'paths' dictionary contains the correct endpoint ('/items/') and its corresponding GET request details (e.g., summary, operationID).
- Checks that the 'components' section includes security schemes like OAuth2AuthorizationCodeBearer with their respective descriptions and flows.
