- This method is annotated with `@DynamicClassAttribute`, which allows it to be called as a class attribute instead of an instance method. - It returns the value of the enum constant corresponding to the name of the current object, using the `ImageDriver` enumeration from the `rio-tiler` library for handling different image formats. - In other words, this method provides a convenient way to retrieve the default profile (i.e., settings) for rendering images in the specified format without having to create an instance of the `ImageDriver`.
