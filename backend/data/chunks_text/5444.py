- Retrieves a list of assets (e.g., images or data files) that intersect with a specific Mercator tile identified by its zoom level (z), column (x), and row (y).
- Dependencies for path, backend parameters, and environment are passed to the function using FastAPI's dependency injection feature.
- The `assets_for_tile()` method is called on an instance of RasterIO's DatasetReader class to perform the actual asset retrieval operation.
