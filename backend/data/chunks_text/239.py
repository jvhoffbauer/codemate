1. Creates a SQLAlchemy database connection using an in-memory SQLite database and disables thread checking for concurrent access. Uses StaticPool to reuse connections instead of creating new ones each time.
2. Defines the location of the SQLite database as `sqlite://`.
3. Specifies that the connection pool should be created using the StaticPool class instead of the default ThreadLocalSessionPackagingConnectionPool. This allows multiple requests to use the same connection without creating new ones.
