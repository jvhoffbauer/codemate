- Defines an asynchronous method `exec()` in a class that inherits from SQLAlchemy's `BaseQuery`.
- Takes a single argument of type `SelectOfScalar`, which represents a SELECT query with a scalar result (e.g., retrieving a single value).
- Allows optional arguments for passing parameters to the query and customizing its behavior through various options.
- Returns a `ScalarResult` object containing the resulting scalar values after executing the query.
