- Defines a Celery task called `test_celery` with name `aks_late`.
- Accepts a single argument, `word`, of type string.
- Returns a formatted message that includes the value passed as an argument for `word`.
- The `acks_late` parameter is set to True, which means that results will be acknowledged after processing has completed instead of immediately after receiving them from the worker. This can help reduce network latency and improve performance in certain scenarios.
