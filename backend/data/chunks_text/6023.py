- Registers a custom admin for a model named `Tmp` using Django's built-in Admin site (`@site.register_admin`) and sets it as an instance of `LinkAdmin`, which is a subclass of Django's default `ModelAdmin`. - Defines a single attribute, `link`, that holds the URL to display in the admin interface instead of the standard list view or change form. This can be useful for models with external representations or data sources.
