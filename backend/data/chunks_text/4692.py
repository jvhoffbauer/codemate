- This function tests the `POST /uploadfile/` endpoint by uploading a file using the `files` parameter in the request body. - The file is created at a temporary directory (specified by `tmp_path`) and written to it before being opened for reading. - After sending the request, the status code of the response is checked against 200, and if successful, the filename of the uploaded file is extracted from the JSON response.
