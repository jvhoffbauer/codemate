- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()` that takes multiple optional arguments for filtering and sorting items based on their processing requirements.
- Converts some of these arguments (such as datetime objects) into more useful formats like timestamps or time deltas using default values provided by FastAPI's `Body` parameter decorator.
- Returns a dictionary containing all the relevant information about the filtered items, including the original ID, starting and ending times, repeating interval, required delay before processing, adjusted start time, and duration of each item's execution window.
