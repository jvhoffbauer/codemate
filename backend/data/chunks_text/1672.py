- This function is an asynchronous coroutine that takes a boolean argument `fixed_content_included`, which defaults to the value returned by the `Depends()` decorator applied to the `checker` object. - The function returns a dictionary with a single key, "fixed_content_in_query", whose value is either the default value of `fixed_content_included` or the result of calling the `checker` dependency resolver. - The purpose of this function seems to be providing a query parameter for checking whether a request contains any fixed content (i.e., data that doesn't change between requests). By passing this parameter to other functions in the application, they can make decisions based on its value without having to retrieve it from the request context themselves.
