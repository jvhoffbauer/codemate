- Defines a fixture named `client` using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called by PyTest when it encounters this fixture in tests that use it. - Inside the function, we first import the Flask application object (`app`) from our tutorial example at `docs_src/response_model/tutorial003_01_py310`. - We then create a new instance of Flask's built-in test client (`TestClient`) with our `app`, and assign it to the variable `client`. - Finally, we return the `client` object so that other functions can access it via the `client` fixture name.
