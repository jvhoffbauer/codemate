- This method checks if a user has permission to perform an action on a specific page using Django Rest Framework's `ActionPermission` feature. - The `async def` keyword is used to make this function asynchronous for better performance and scalability in web applications. - The `self.admin` attribute refers to the parent class of this method (presumably `PageSchemaAdmin`) which provides access to the authentication system and other necessary context for checking permissions.
