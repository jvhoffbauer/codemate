- Defines a property named `route_create` that returns a callable function with no arguments and any return type (represented by 'Any'). - Throws an exception ('NotImplementedError') if this method is called, indicating that it should be implemented in subclasses of this class. This pattern is commonly used as part of the "Template Method" design pattern to provide default behavior for certain methods while allowing subclasses to override them as needed.
