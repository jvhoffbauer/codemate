- Defines an asynchronous function `get_async_raise` that takes a dependency `state` from `Depends(asyncgen_state_try)`.
- Asserts that the value of `state` is equal to a specific string, indicating some precondition for this function's execution.
- Raises an exception `AsyncDependencyError`, simulating a failure in the dependency chain.
