- This function is a POST request handler for the `"/uploadfile"` endpoint in our FastAPI application. - It takes an optional parameter `file`, which can be either an instance of `UploadFile` or `None`. - If no file is provided, it returns a message indicating that fact; otherwise, it returns the filename of the uploaded file as a dictionary key-value pair.
