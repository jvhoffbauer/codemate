- Defines a function `get_server_api()` that returns the URL of the server API by concatenating the server name (stored in `config.SERVER_NAME`) with "http://". - The variable `config` is assumed to be an external configuration object containing the value for `SERVER_NAME`. This implementation assumes that this configuration object has already been initialized and made available at runtime.
