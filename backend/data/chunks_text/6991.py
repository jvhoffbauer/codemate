- This method is called to authenticate a user using their email and password. - It takes in a database session (db), an email address (email), and a password (password). - First, it retrieves the user with the given email from the database using `self.get_by_email()`. - If the user doesn't exist, it returns `None`. - Otherwise, it checks whether the provided password matches the stored hash of the password for this user using `verify_password()`. - If the passwords don't match, it also returns `None`. - If both steps pass, it returns the authenticated user object.
