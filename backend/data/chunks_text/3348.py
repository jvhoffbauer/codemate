- Defines a new route for POST requests to `"/form/python-tuple"` using FastAPI's decorator syntax. - Accepts a single argument, `items`, which is bound to the value of the form data submitted via an HTML form with the name "items". - The type hint specifies that this parameter should be a Python tuple, and it will automatically be converted from the request body by FastAPI's built-in `Form` parser.
