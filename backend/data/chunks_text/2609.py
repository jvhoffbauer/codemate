- This function is a PATCH request handler for modifying an existing item with the given ID (item_id). - The `@app.patch()` decorator specifies that this function should be called when a PATCH request is made to the specified URL path ("/items/{item_id}" where {item_id} will be replaced by the actual value of item_id in the request). - The parameter `item_id: str` indicates that the function expects a string representing the ID of the item being modified as part of the URL path. - The parameter `item: Item` represents the new values for the item being updated and is passed as the body of the request. - The function returns a dictionary containing both the original item ID and the updated item object.
