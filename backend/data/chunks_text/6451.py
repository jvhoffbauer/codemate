- Initializes a new instance of `JSONRPCEndpoint`, which is used to define an API endpoint that conforms to the JSON RPC specification.
- Takes several arguments including the entry point (a class representing the main application), the path of the endpoint, the function to be executed when the endpoint is called, optional result model type, error types, dependency functions, etc.
- Compiles the given path string into its format components, extracts any dependent functions required by this endpoint, inserts them into the list of common dependencies shared between all endpoints defined within the same entry point, and flattens out the resulting merged list of dependencies.
- Creates two models based on the endpoint's metadata - one for incoming requests and another for returning results. These are then passed as arguments to the base class constructor along with other relevant options such as HTTP method, security requirements, etc.
- Defines a dummy endpoint function that doesn't actually perform anything but serves as a placeholder for generating OpenAPI documentation. This function is named after the original user-defined function and inherits its docstring.
- Sets up various attributes of the newly created object, such as the actual user-defined function, the compiled endpoint definition, the parent entry point, middleware functions, etc., before finally initializing the FastAPI app itself using the handle_http_request() method.
