- Defines a function `read_items` that takes an argument `id`, which is expected to be a dictionary. - The function body is empty, indicating that it doesn't perform any action and should not be executed during testing (covered by pragma statement). This could potentially mean that this method needs further implementation or may have been left incomplete for some reason.
