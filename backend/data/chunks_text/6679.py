- This function is a unit test for a `probe()` method that takes JSON requests and returns responses with results. - It creates a mock request object using the `json_request()` decorator provided by some testing framework (e.g., pytest). - The request contains an ID, version of JSON RPC protocol, name of the requested method, and empty parameters dictionary. - The response should have the same ID and JSONRPC version as in the request, but also contain the result returned by the `probe()` method.
