- Defines a computed field named `DEFAULT_SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`, which is both cached and decorated with the `@computed_field` and `@cached_property` decorators from SQLAlchemy. - The value of this field is constructed using the `PostgresDsn.build()` method provided by the `aiopg2` library to build a connection string for an asynchronous PostgreSQL database. - This connection string includes various configuration parameters such as the database schema (`"postgresql+asyncpg"`), user credentials (`username` and `password`), server address (`host`), network port (`port`), and database name (`path`) that are all obtained from other fields in the class.
