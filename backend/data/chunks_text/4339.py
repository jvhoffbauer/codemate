- Defines a fixture named `client` using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called by PyTest when it encounters this fixture in tests that use it. - Inside the `get_function()`, we first import the Flask application object (`app`) from a specific module (`docs_src.body_updates.tutorial001_py39`) and then create a new instance of Flask Client (`TestClient`) with this application as its argument. - Finally, we return this newly created `TestClient` instance so that other test functions can access it via the `client` variable defined at the top level.
