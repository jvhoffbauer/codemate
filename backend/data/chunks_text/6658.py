- Defines a fixture `ep` that takes an entrypoint path as input and returns an instance of FastAPI's `Entrypoint`. The custom request class `CustomJsonRpcRequest` is used instead of the default one to add an additional field called `extra_value`. - Registers a method named 'probe' with the entrypoint using the `method()` decorator from FastAPI. This method accepts a single argument `jsonrpc_method`, which is obtained through the `Depends` function provided by FastAPI. - Returns the created entrypoint object.
