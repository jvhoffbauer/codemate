- Defines a function called `ep_path()` that returns a string representing the endpoint path for JSON RPC API version 1 and protocol version 1 (default). - This function can be used to easily access the correct endpoint URL without hardcoding it in multiple places throughout the application, making it more maintainable and scalable as new versions of the API are added or removed.
