- Creates a temporary JSON file (with.gz extension) using Python's `tempfile` module and saves its name to a variable called `fileobj`. The file is deleted by default but we set `delete=False` so that it persists after this function exits.
- Loads an array of URLs into a `MosaicJSON` object representing a collection of raster datasets. This class is part of the GDAL library for geospatial data manipulation.
- Saves the resulting mosaic dataset to the temporary file using the `FileBackend` class from the same library. We pass in the filename obtained earlier and specify the input mosaic definition (i.e., metadata about how the individual layers should be combined).
- Yields the filename back to whoever called this function, allowing them to use it elsewhere if needed.
- Deletes the temporary file at the end using Python's built-in `os.remove()` method. Note that we wrap this operation inside a `try...finally` block to ensure that it gets executed regardless of whether or not an exception occurs while returning the filename.
