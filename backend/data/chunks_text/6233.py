- `get_locations()` function retrieves a dictionary of county locations from an API endpoint and caches it for one hour (TTL). - If the location data exists in the shared cache, it returns that instead of making another request. - Otherwise, it makes a GET request to the API endpoint, parses the CSV response into a list of dictionaries representing each location, normalizes the data, saves it to the local cache, and then returns the list of locations.
