- Creates a new database session using the `Session()` function from SQLAlchemy's ORM (Object Relational Mapping). - Uses a context manager to automatically close and dispose of the session after it is used, preventing resource leaks or errors caused by forgetting to manually close sessions. - Yields the session object for use in other functions or blocks of code within the same scope, allowing multiple parts of an application to access the same database connection without having to repeatedly create and destroy sessions.
