- Defines an `async` function called `set_redis_key` that takes a `RedisData` object and optional boolean flag for transaction mode. - Uses the `aioredis` library's pipeline feature to execute multiple commands in one network round trip. - Sets the key-value pair using the `set` command and optionally sets the TTL (time-to-live) expiration time using the `expire` command. - Executes the pipeline of commands synchronously using the `execute` method.
