- Defines a middleware function called `custom_middleware` that takes in a `Request` object and a `Callable` (i.e., a function that returns an asynchronous coroutine) representing the next middleware or handler to be invoked. - Uses the `await` keyword to invoke the next middleware/handler using the `call_next()` method passed as an argument. - Sets a new header named 'custom' with value 'foo' on the response returned by the next middleware/handler. - Returns the modified response.
