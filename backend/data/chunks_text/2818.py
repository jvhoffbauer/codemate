- Tests that a GET request to `/query/param-required` with no query parameter returns a 422 status code and an error message indicating that the query parameter is required. - Uses Pytest's built-in fixtures (client) for making HTTP requests against our Flask app. - Utilizes Pydantic's validation features by passing in a custom validator function as part of the route decorator. This ensures that any incoming data conforms to the expected schema before it's processed further within the application logic.
