- This test checks if an inactive user is returned a 400 Bad Request error when trying to retrieve their own information using an access token with the'me' scope. - The `get_access_token` function from FastAPI's built-in OAuth2 authentication implementation is used to generate an access token for Alice with the provided credentials and scope. - The generated access token is included as an Authorization header in the GET request to the '/users/me' endpoint.
