- Defines a function `get_missing_field_error()` that takes a tuple of location strings (`loc`) as input and returns an error dictionary with specific details about the missing field. - Uses Pydantic's `ValidationError` class to create an error object from the exception data provided ("Field required"). - Extracts the first error in the list returned by `ValidationError.errors()`, which corresponds to the validation failure for the missing field. - Modifies the extracted error by setting its 'input' key to `None`. This is necessary because when using this error message in a custom validator, we want it to be displayed without any additional context related to the user's input. - Returns the modified error dictionary. Note: The `# type: ignore[return-value]` comment at the end is used to suppress a mypy warning about returning a value whose type cannot be determined statically. In this case, the actual return type is a dict, but mypy can't infer it due to the dynamic nature of the `ValidationError.errors()` method.
