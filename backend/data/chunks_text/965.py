- Defines a function `create_body_model()` that takes two arguments: `fields`, which is a sequence of ModelFields, and `model_name`, which is the name of the new BaseModel to be created. - Inside the function, it creates a dictionary called `field_params` with keys as the names of each field and values as tuples containing their annotations and corresponding FieldInfo objects from the original Model class's MetaData. - It then uses Pydantic's built-in `create_model()` function to dynamically generate a new BaseModel named after `model_name`. The `**field_params` argument passes all the key-value pairs from our `field_params` dictionary into `create_model()`. This allows us to specify the types and validation logic for each field without having to manually define them again in the new BaseModel. - Finally, we assign this newly generated BaseModel to a variable called `BodyModel` and return it.
