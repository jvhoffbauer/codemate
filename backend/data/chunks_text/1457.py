- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()`. - The function returns a list or other iterable called `items`, which is assumed to contain data that needs to be retrieved from some external resource (e.g., database, API). - Since this function is marked asynchronous using the `async` keyword, it can potentially run concurrently with other tasks in an event loop and improve overall application performance.
