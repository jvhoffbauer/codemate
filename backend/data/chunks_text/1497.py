- Defines a GET request for `/items/`, with an optional query parameter `q`.
- Uses Pydantic's `Query` decorator to parse and validate the `q` parameter as a string of at least 3 characters (min_length).
- Returns a dictionary containing either just the list of items or also includes the filtered search results based on the value of `q`.
