- Defines an asynchronous function `info()` that takes a dependency on the application's configuration (`config.Settings`) and returns a dictionary containing three key-value pairs representing important information about the app. - The returned dictionary contains the name of the app, the email address of its administrator, and the maximum number of items allowed for each user. - This function can be used to provide this information in various parts of the application without having to repeat the same code multiple times or hardcode these values.
