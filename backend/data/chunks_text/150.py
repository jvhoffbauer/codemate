- Defines a function called `select` with four arguments (`__ent0`, `entity_1`, `entity_2`, and `entity_3`) of types `_TCCA[_T0]`, `_TScalar_1`, `_TScalar_2`, and `_TScalar_3`, respectively. The `type: ignore` annotation is used to suppress mypy's warning about unused variables. - Returns a new object of type `Select` that contains tuples consisting of elements from the input iterable `__ent0` along with values selected based on conditions involving `entity_1`, `entity_2`, and `entity_3`. This operation is commonly referred to as filtering or selecting specific columns in database terminology.
