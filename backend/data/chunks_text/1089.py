1. This function `get_current_user()` takes two arguments - `SecurityScopes` and a JWT token obtained from OAuth2 authentication scheme using FastAPI dependency injection mechanism.
2. It checks whether any scopes are provided by the client application during authorization request. If yes, it adds them to the Authentication header value as part of Bearer token format.
3. The function tries to decode the JWT token with the help of PyJWT library and extracts the sub (subject) field which represents the username of the logged-in user.
4. If the decoding fails or the subject field is missing, an exception is raised indicating that the credentials could not be validated.
5. Otherwise, the function retrieves the user object from the database based on the extracted username and returns it.
6. Before returning the user object, this function also verifies whether the requested scopes match with the granted scopes present in the JWT token. If there is a mismatch, another exception is thrown indicating insufficient permissions.
