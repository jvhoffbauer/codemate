- This function is a FastAPI endpoint that takes in a `Request`, an optional authentication token (`authenticated`), and a payload containing house data for prediction (`block_data`) as arguments. - It retrieves the loaded machine learning model from the application state (`request.app.state.model`) and passes the input data to it using the `predict()` method. - The predicted output is returned as a `HousePredictionResult`.
