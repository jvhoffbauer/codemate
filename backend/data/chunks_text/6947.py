- This endpoint retrieves a list of User objects using FastAPI's dependency injection mechanism to retrieve an SQLAlchemy Session object and pass it to CRUD functions defined in `crud_user`. - The `response_model` parameter specifies that the API response should conform to the `UserOut` model (presumably defined elsewhere). - Two query parameters are accepted: `offset`, which determines where in the database results to start returning rows from, and `limit`, which limits the number of rows returned by the query. These values can be used to implement pagination if desired.
