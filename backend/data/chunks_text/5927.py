- Defines a function `model_fields` that takes a type of BaseModel as an argument (`model`) and returns a dictionary containing all its fields with their corresponding ModelFields objects. - Uses Python's built-in attribute `__fields__` to retrieve a tuple of Field instances defined in the given BaseModel class. - Converts this tuple into a dictionary using the field names as keys and creates ModelField objects for each key-value pair before returning it.
