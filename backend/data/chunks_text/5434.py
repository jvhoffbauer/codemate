- This function is an endpoint that returns the value of a specific point on a mosaic using FastAPI and RasterIO libraries. - It takes several dependencies including `response`, `lon`, `lat`, `src_path`, `layer_params`, `dataset_params`, `backend_params`, `reader_params`, and `env`. - The function sets up some environment variables related to concurrency and creates a dictionary containing the coordinates and corresponding values at those coordinates from the input parameters. - Finally, it returns this dictionary as JSON format through the `JSONResponse` class provided by FastAPI.
