- Tests if an admin user with a valid token can access the /admin endpoint by making a POST request and checking for a successful status code (200) and expected JSON response. - The `test_admin` function takes in a `TestClient` object from FastAPI's built-in testing framework to simulate HTTP requests. - Two different authentication mechanisms are used simultaneously: query parameter `token` and header `X-Token`. This demonstrates how multiple forms of authentication can be implemented at once.
