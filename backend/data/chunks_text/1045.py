- Defines a function `get_sub_dependant()` that takes several arguments related to dependencies and security requirements for an API endpoint. - The function returns a `Dependant` object representing the dependent resource required by this endpoint. - If the main dependency is secured with OAuth2 or OpenID Connect authentication, it adds the necessary scopes from both sources to the list of required scopes. - It then calls another helper function `get_dependant()` to create the actual dependent resource based on the given parameters. - Finally, it appends any added security requirement to the list of security requirements for the dependent resource.
