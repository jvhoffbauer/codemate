- Retrieves user information for the currently authenticated user using FastAPI's dependency injection and `Depends()`.
- Returns the retrieved user object as a JSON response.
- Uses the `read_users_me()` function to handle GET requests to the "/users/me" endpoint, which requires authentication through the `get_current_user()` decorator provided by FastAPI's security middleware.
