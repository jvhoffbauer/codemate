- This function is a GET request for retrieving a specific hero with ID `hero_id`.
- It uses FastAPI's dependency injection to retrieve an SQLAlchemy session from the database connection pool (`get_session`) and pass it as a parameter to this function.
- The `response_model` decorator specifies that the returned value should be serialized according to the `HeroRead` model defined elsewhere in the application.
- If the requested hero cannot be found in the database, a customized HTTP error with status code 404 ("Not Found") is raised instead of returning a generic "Resource Not Found" message.
