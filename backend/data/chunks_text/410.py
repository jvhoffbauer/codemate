- Defines a new method `reject_none()` for a custom class (`cls`) that takes an argument `v`. - The function checks if the input value `v` is `None`, and raises an AssertionError exception with a descriptive message if it is. This ensures that `None` values are never passed to this method accidentally or intentionally. - If the input value is not `None`, the original value `v` is returned as is.
