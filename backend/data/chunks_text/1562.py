- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()` that takes a positional argument `q` of type `Union[List[str], None]`. This allows the user to pass either a list of strings or `None` as the default value. - The function returns a dictionary called `query_items`, which contains a key-value pair with the name "q" and its corresponding value from the `q` parameter passed in by the caller. - By using the `Query` decorator, Pydantic's validation is applied to ensure that the input `q` conforms to the expected format (a list of strings). If it doesn't conform, a validation error will be raised.
