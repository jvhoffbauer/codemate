- This function is asynchronous and takes an `item_id` parameter of type string. - It first checks whether the given `item_id` exists in a dictionary called `items`. If it doesn't exist, it raises a custom error with status code 404 (Not Found) and a message explaining that the item was not found. - Otherwise, it returns a JSON response containing just the requested item under the key `"item"`.
