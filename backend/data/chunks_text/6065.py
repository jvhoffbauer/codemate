- This function tests the `sqlmodel-sqlalchemy-crud` library's ability to update a database model using an updated schema defined by the user. - It creates a custom `UserUpdate` schema that includes only the `password` field and excludes the `username` field from the original `User` model. - The `UserCrud` object is created with this new schema and registered as a CRUD endpoint under the `/user` prefix. - The OpenAPI documentation for the API is checked to ensure that the updated schema is correctly reflected there. - Two test cases are run: one where the wrong field (`username`) is attempted to be updated, which should result in an error; and another where the correct field (`password`) is updated successfully.
