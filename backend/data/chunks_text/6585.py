- This function `probe2` is decorated with FastAPI's dependency injection decorator, `@ep.method()`.
- It takes two dependencies as arguments: an authentication token (`auth_token`) and a custom dependency called `probe2_dep` (defined elsewhere).
- The values of these dependencies are obtained using FastAPI's `Depends` utility function, which allows us to pass them into our function without having to manually manage their lifecycle or scope.
- Inside the function body, we delete the unused variables `auth_token` and `probe2_dep`, since they were already passed in through the `Depends` mechanism and we don't need to keep references to them anymore.
- Finally, the function returns an integer value of `1`.
