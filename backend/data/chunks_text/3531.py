- Defines a GET request for items with an ID specified in the URL path (/items/{id}) using FastAPI's decorator syntax (@app.get)
- The parameter id is passed as a tuple, indicating that it can contain multiple values separated by commas (e.g., /items/123,456)
- The function body currently contains a placeholder statement to avoid running unimplemented logic during testing (pragma: no cover).
