- Defines a fixture named `client` using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called when the fixture is invoked in tests. - Inside the function, we first import the Flask application object (`app`) from the file `docs_src/query_params/tutorial006`. - We then create a new instance of the `TestClient` class provided by Flask's testing module and pass it our `app` object as an argument. - Finally, we return the newly created client object for use in tests that invoke the `client` fixture.
