- Defines a class method `find_first` that takes an optional list of sorting fields (`order_by`) and arbitrary keyword arguments for filtering (`**kwargs`). - If no sorting fields are provided, sets the default to sort by ID in descending order (-ID). - Returns the first object found after applying filters and sorting using Django's built-in query methods.
