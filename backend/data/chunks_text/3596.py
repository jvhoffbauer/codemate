- Defines a GET endpoint `/simple_exclude_dict` with a customized response schema (`Model2`) and excludes the nested dictionary key 'bar' from being included in the serialized JSON output using the `response_model_exclude` parameter. - Returns a dictionary containing two keys ('ref', 'baz') where'ref' is itself another dictionary containing two keys ('foo', 'bar').
