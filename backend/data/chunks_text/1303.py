- Defines an asynchronous function `create_files` that takes a list of bytes (representing binary data) as its argument, with a default value of an empty list returned by the built-in `File` context manager. - The function returns a dictionary containing a single key-value pair, where the key is "file_sizes" and the corresponding value is a list of integers representing the lengths of each byte array passed to the function.
