- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()` that takes a single optional argument `q`.
- The default value of `q` is set to `None` using the `Query` decorator from Pydantic's ORM library.
- If `q` is provided, it will be added to a dictionary called `query_items`, which contains a key named "q". This dictionary can then be used in subsequent API requests or database queries.
