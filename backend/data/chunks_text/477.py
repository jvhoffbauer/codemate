- Imports `test_tutorial` function and `create_engine` function from SQLAlchemy's `orm` module.
- Defines a variable called `mod` to hold the imported `tutorial002_py310` module from the `docs_src.tutorial.where` package.
- Sets the value of `mod.sqlite_url` to a string representing an in-memory SQLite database.
- Creates a new engine using `create_engine`.
- Initializes a list called `calls` to store output values printed during execution.
- Retrieves the built-in print function and replaces it with a custom one that saves its arguments to `calls`.
- Calls the main function of the `mod` module within a context manager that restores the original print function after execution.
- Asserts that the expected output is stored in `calls`, which should be a nested list containing dictionaries representing each row returned by the SELECT statement executed in the `mod.main()` method.
