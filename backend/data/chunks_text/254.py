- This function is a FastAPI route with an endpoint `/teams/{team_id}` and returns a Team object with its associated Hero objects (defined by `response_model`) when called with a specific `team_id`. - The `Depends()` decorator is used to pass in a database connection from the `get_session()` function as an argument for this function's execution. - If the requested `team_id` doesn't exist in the database, a customized HTTP error with status code 404 is raised using the `raise HTTPException()` statement.
