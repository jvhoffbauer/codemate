- Tests a rare edge case where a nullable integer is used as the primary key of an SQLAlchemy model (using `SQLModel`) and creates a corresponding database table with that column defined as NULLABLE. This should not be commonly encountered in practice, but it's still worth testing to ensure correctness. - The test uses the `pytest-xdist` plugin to clear the SQLite database between tests using the `clear_sqlmodel` fixture provided by `pytest-asv`. - It also logs any messages generated during the execution of the test using the `caplog` context manager from `pytest-logging`, which allows us to verify that the expected CREATE TABLE statement was issued by SQLAlchemy.
