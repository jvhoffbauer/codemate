- Defines three subclasses of SQLModel representing different types of pets (cats, dogs, and lizards). Each subclass has a `pet_type` field that indicates its specific type. - Creates a base model called `Model`, which contains an instance of one of these subclasses as well as another integer field called `n`. The `pet` field is defined using Pydantic's `Union` type to allow any of the three subclasses. Its `discriminator` argument specifies the name of the field in each subclass that should be used for distinguishing between them. - Instantiates an example object of the `Model` class, passing in a dictionary representation of a dog. This works because the `discriminator` value ("dog") matches the corresponding `pet_type` value in the input data. - Attempts to instantiate another example object without providing a value for the `barks` field, which causes a validation error since this field is required by the `Dog` subclass.
