- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()` that takes a parameter `q` of type `Annotated[Union[List[str], None], Query()]`. This means that `q` can be either a list of strings or `None`, and it is annotated with the `Query()` decorator, which indicates that it will be used in a database query. - Inside the function, a dictionary called `query_items` is created with a key "q" containing the value of the `q` parameter passed to the function. - The function returns the `query_items` dictionary.
