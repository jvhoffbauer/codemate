- Defines a GET request for items with an ID specified in the URL path (/items/{id}) using FastAPI's decorator syntax (@app.get)
- The parameter id is passed as a dictionary, which allows for more complex key-value pairs to be included in the URL path if needed
- The function body currently contains a placeholder statement (pass) and will need to be implemented with actual functionality later on
