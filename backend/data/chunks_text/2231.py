- Defines a function `test_complex` that creates an instance of FastAPI and registers a POST endpoint with two possible input types (string or list).
- Creates a TestClient object to simulate HTTP requests against the application.
- Makes two separate POST requests, one with a string payload and another with a list payload, and asserts that both responses have the expected status codes and JSON representations.
