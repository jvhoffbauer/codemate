- Defines a function `create_heroes` that creates a new hero and adds it to a team using SQLAlchemy ORM. - Creates a new `Session` object for interacting with the database, which is then used to add a new `Team` called "Z-Force" with its headquarters at Sister Margaret's Bar. - Creates a new `Hero` named Deadpool (with his real name Dive Wilson), assigning him to the newly created team. - Commits changes made in this session to the database. - Refreshes the state of the `Hero` object to ensure any changes made by other sessions are reflected locally. - Prints out details about the newly created hero and its assigned team.
