- This method is an asynchronous function that checks if a user has permission to create a resource using FastAPI's built-in `has_*_permission()` decorator. - It takes three arguments: `self`, which represents the current instance of the API endpoint; `request`, which contains information about the incoming HTTP request; and `data`, which holds the data being submitted by the client in JSON format (as defined by the `SchemaCreateT` type). - The `**kwargs` parameter allows for additional keyword arguments to be passed through to the decorated function, but we are not making use of it here. - Inside the function, we call another helper method called `has_page_permission()`. This method also uses the `has_*_permission()` decorator to check whether the user has permission to perform the specified CRUD operation on this particular page or resource. In our case, we pass `action=CrudEnum.create` to indicate that we want to allow creation of new resources. By returning the result of `has_page_permission()`, we can ensure that users have both global permissions to interact with the resource and specific permissions to access and manipulate individual pages within it.
