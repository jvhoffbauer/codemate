- This function handles a PUT request to update an existing item with specific parameters passed in the body using FastAPI's `@app.put()` decorator and the `UUID`, `Body()`, and `Annotated` functions for type hinting and validation.
- The function takes six arguments: `item_id`, `start_datetime`, `end_datetime`, `repeat_at`, `process_after`, all of which are optional and can be set as `None`. These arguments represent different aspects of the item being updated, such as its ID, starting datetime, ending datetime, repeating interval, processing delay, etc.
- Inside the function, some calculations are performed based on these input values to derive additional properties that will be returned along with the original ones. For example, `start_process` is calculated by adding the `process_after` value to the `start_datetime`, while `duration` is computed as the difference between `end_datetime` and `start_process`.
