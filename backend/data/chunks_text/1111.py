- This function retrieves the currently authenticated and authorized user using FastAPI's `Security()` decorator with the `get_current_user()` callback function to retrieve the user object from the request context. - The `scopes` parameter is set to "me", which restricts access to resources that are specifically marked as accessible by the logged-in user (i.e., resources that require authentication). - If the user account is disabled, a custom error response is raised with an HTTP status code of 400 Bad Request and a detailed message explaining why the operation failed.
