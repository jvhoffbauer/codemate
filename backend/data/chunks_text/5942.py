- This function sets the internationalization (i18n) localization language for an object. It takes a language parameter as input and returns the final language that was successfully set. - If no language is provided, this function tries to retrieve the language from several sources: the `LANGUAGE` and `LANG` environment variables, the current locale's first component, and finally defaults to 'en_US'. - After setting the language, the function clears the translation cache of the gettext module and performs garbage collection to ensure any changes are immediately applied.
