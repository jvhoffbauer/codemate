- Defines a Pydantic model `ModelWithDatetimeField` that includes a datetime field and sets up JSON encoder for datetime fields to convert them into ISO format without time zone information. - Creates an instance of this model with a specific datetime value. - Registers a route in FastAPI that returns the created model as its response. - Uses Pytest's built-in testing framework (TestClient) to make a GET request to the registered route and checks if the returned JSON matches the expected output.
