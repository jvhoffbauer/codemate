- This endpoint returns a JSON response with some application information using FastAPI's `Depends()` function to inject the app configuration into the handler as an argument. - The returned dictionary includes the name of the application (`app_name`), email address for administrative purposes (`admin_email`), and the maximum number of items that can be associated with each user account (`items_per_user`) from the loaded configuration object passed in via dependency injection.
