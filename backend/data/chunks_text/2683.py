- This endpoint returns a dictionary with user data as response, including an extra field `"password_hash"` that is not part of the `User` model defined in FastAPI's OpenAPI schema. - The function signature follows PEP8 naming conventions and uses type hinting to specify the expected return value (a `User` object). However, since we are returning a dictionary instead, this annotation is misleading and should be removed or adjusted accordingly. - By convention, endpoints that don't follow the standard behavior for their HTTP method (e.g., returning something other than JSON) should use descriptive names that clearly indicate what they do. In this case, the name could be changed to reflect the fact that it returns a custom dictionary rather than a `User` instance.
