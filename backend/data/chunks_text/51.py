- This function takes a class `cls` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether it's a table model class based on its configuration attribute'model_config'. - If'model_config' exists for the given class, this function checks if the 'table' key in that dictionary is set to True (or any truthy value). - If neither'model_config' nor 'table' are found, the function assumes the class isn't a table model.
