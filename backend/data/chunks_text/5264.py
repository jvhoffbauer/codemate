1. This function takes an `ImageData` object as input and returns a new `ImageData` with a hillshade overlay created using the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in the original dataset.
2. The function extracts the elevation values and masks from the input `ImageData`, along with its bounding box and coordinate reference system (CRS). It also accepts optional arguments for buffering the output image and adjusting the angle of incidence for the sun's rays.
3. Using NumPy functions, it calculates the slopes, aspects, and azimuths based on the gradient of the elevations. These are then used to create a shading factor that ranges between -1 (deep shadow) and 1 (full sunlight).
4. Finally, the resulting hillshade array is expanded into a three-dimensional tensor with one channel, converted to unsigned integer format, and returned as a new `ImageData`. If buffering was requested, the output image is cropped accordingly and the bounding box is adjusted accordingly.
