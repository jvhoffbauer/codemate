- This function takes a value `v` of any type (string or integer) and a type hint `type_`. It returns the original value after some transformations based on the input data types. - If the input value is a string and empty, it checks whether the expected output type is an enumeration class with an empty string as a member. In this case, it returns the empty string; otherwise, it raises a validation error. - If the input value is a non-empty string but the expected output type is an integer, it converts the string to an integer before returning it. - If the input value is an integer and the expected output type is a string, it converts the integer to a string before returning it.
