- Tests if `ml_models` dictionary is initially empty and checks that it remains so after making a prediction request using Flask's built-in testing client (TestClient). - Verifies that the predefined ML model for answering 'the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything' is correctly loaded into the `ml_models` dictionary at startup time. - Makes an HTTP GET request to the '/predict' endpoint passing in an input value ('x') of 2, and ensures that the status code returned by the server is 200 OK and that the predicted output is correct.
