- Defines a fixture named `client` for use in pytests using Flask's `TestClient`.
- Imports the necessary module and creates an instance of `TestClient`, which is used to test Flask applications without running them as web servers.
- Returns the created `TestClient` object, making it available for use in other tests that require access to a Flask application context.
