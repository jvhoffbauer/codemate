- This function handles a POST request to the `"/uploadfiles"` endpoint and returns a JSON response containing an array of filenames from the uploaded files. - The `Annotated` decorator is used to define the type hints for the `files` parameter, which is a list of `UploadFile` objects obtained using FastAPI's built-in `File` class. - The `description` argument passed to the `File` constructor provides additional information about the expected format of the request body.
