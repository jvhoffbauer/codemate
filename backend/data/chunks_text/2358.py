- Defines a function called `callback4` that takes a single argument, `level4`, of type string. - The function is marked asynchronous using the `async` keyword. - The body of the function is empty and includes a docstring with the `pragma: nocover` directive to suppress coverage analysis for this block of code. This suggests that this function may be used in testing or debugging purposes but not necessarily executed during normal program execution.
