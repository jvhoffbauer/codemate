- Defines a `build_resp_model` class method that creates a Pydantic model for representing JSON RPC errors and responses.
- Creates a dictionary of field definitions with default values and examples from the base classes' attributes.
- Checks whether there is an associated data model and adds it to the response structure as an optional field.
- Generates a new Pydantic model for the error response by extending BaseModel and adding required fields like 'jsonrpc', 'id', and 'error'.
- Applies configuration settings to the generated model using ConfigDict.
