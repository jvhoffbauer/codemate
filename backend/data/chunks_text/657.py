- This function is an asynchronous method that handles outgoing requests. - It checks whether the request type is 'http.response.start' and retrieves a value from the 'correlation_id' dictionary (which may be empty). - If there is a non-empty 'correlation_id', it adds this ID to the HTTP response headers using the 'MutableHeaders' class provided by Starlette. - Finally, it sends the modified message using the'send()' function.
