- This function takes a boolean argument `fixed_content_included`, which is annotated with the `Depends` decorator and passed to the `checker` dependency resolver. - The function returns a dictionary containing a key "fixed_content_in_query" whose value is the same as the input boolean parameter. - The purpose of this function seems to be passing a boolean flag indicating whether query parameters should include fixed content or not, for further processing in other functions that depend on it.
