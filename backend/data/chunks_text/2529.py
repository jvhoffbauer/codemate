- Defines a web socket endpoint at `"/router-ws-depends/"`, decorated with the `@router.websocket` decorator from FastAPI's Router class. - Accepts two arguments: `websocket` (a WebSocket object representing the client connection), and `data` (an optional dependency provided by the `Depends` function wrapper around `ws_dependency`. - Calls `await websocket.accept()` to accept the incoming WebSocket handshake request. - Sends a text message back to the client using `await websocket.send_text(data)`, where `data` is passed in as an argument. - Closes the WebSocket connection using `await websocket.close()`.
