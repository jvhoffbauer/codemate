- Retrieves a specific user with the given `username` from the database using FastAPI's dependency injection and SQLAlchemy's CRUD functions. - Checks whether the retrieved user is equal to the currently authenticated user obtained through the `Depends` decorator and the `get_current_active_user` function provided by FastAPI's security middleware. - If the user matches the current one, returns it; otherwise, raises an exception with a custom error message when the current user has insufficient privileges or is not superuser.
