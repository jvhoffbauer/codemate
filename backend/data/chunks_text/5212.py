- Defines a dataclass called `TMSFactory` that serves as a factory for creating tile matrix set endpoints using FastAPI. - Provides default values for the `supported_tms`, `router`, and `router_prefix` attributes through the `field` decorator from the `typing_extensions` module. - Implements an initializer method `__post_init__()` to perform post initialization tasks such as registering routes. - Includes a helper function `url_for()` to generate URLs based on the current request context and the defined router prefix. - Registers two GET endpoints for retrieving lists or details about tile matrix sets using the `@self.router.get()` decorator provided by FastAPI's routing system. The first one returns a list of all known tile matrix sets, while the second one provides detailed information about a single identified tile matrix set. Both methods are decorated with metadata describing their functionality and usage.
