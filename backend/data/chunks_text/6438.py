- This method is called when a JSON RPC request needs to be processed by the server. - It tries to validate the raw request using the `model_validate()` method of the request class, which raises a `ValidationError` if the request is not valid according to its schema definition. - If validation fails, it converts the exception into an instance of `InvalidRequestFromValidationError`, which is a custom error type that inherits from `JsonRPCException`. The new error object can then be raised and handled by the client or other parts of the application.
