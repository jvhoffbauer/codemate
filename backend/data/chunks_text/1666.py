- This function takes a parameter `dep_b`, which is an instance of class `DepB`. It's injected using the `@Depends` decorator with `dependency_b` as its argument. - Inside this function, we create an object called `dep_c` and pass it to the `yield` statement. The `async` keyword before the function name indicates that this function returns an async generator. - After generating `dep_c`, we close it in a `finally` block by passing `dep_b` as an argument to `close()`. This ensures proper resource management for both `dep_c` and `dep_b`.
