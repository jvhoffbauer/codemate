- Tests raising a FileNotFoundError for an unsupported image format (in this case, "foo.tif"). - Uses Flask's `app.get()` method to simulate a GET request with a URL parameter of "url" set to "foo.tif". - Asserts that the status code returned by the server is 500 (internal server error), which should be raised due to the missing or invalid file.
