- This function, named `get_sync_sync`, takes an optional argument `state` with a default value provided by the `Depends()` decorator and its generator function `generator_state`. - The returned value is simply the input `state`, indicating that this function synchronously returns the same object passed to it as an argument or generated by the dependency resolver. - In other words, this function can be used in place of the original dependency when we want to avoid async/await syntax for some reason (e.g., compatibility with older libraries).
