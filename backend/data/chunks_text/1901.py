- Defines an asynchronous function `sum_numbers` that takes a list of integers (default value provided by `Body`) and returns their sum using Python's built-in `sum` function. - The `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator is not used, indicating this function can be tested synchronously with pytest. - The `Body` decorator from the `aiohttp` library is used to provide a default value for the `numbers` parameter, allowing callers to omit it if they wish. This feature simplifies API usage and reduces boilerplate code.
