- This endpoint uses the `Depends` function to pass both contexts (A and B) as arguments to the handler function. - The handler function checks that the values of the context variables are correct, indicating that they were set correctly in their respective endpoints. - If everything is okay, an exception (`OtherDependencyError`) is raised, which will be caught by FastAPI's error handling mechanism.
