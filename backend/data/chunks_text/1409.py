- This function is a GET request handler for retrieving an item with a specific ID (stored in `item_id`) using FastAPI's decorator syntax (@app.get). - If the requested item has an ID of 3, it raises a custom HTTPException with status code 418 and a detailed error message ("Nope! I don't like 3."). - Otherwise, it returns a simple dictionary containing just the requested item ID as its value.
