- Tests that sending a POST request to the login endpoint without any data in the body results in a HTTP status code of 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and an error message containing details about missing required fields 'username' and 'password'. The error message is generated by Pydantic's validation process. - The error message format may change depending on whether we are using Pydantic version 1 or 2, as indicated by the `match_pydantic_error_url` helper function which checks for the specific URL pattern used in each version's error messages.
