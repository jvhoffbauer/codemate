- Tests creating a new user with a new email address using an existing superuser's token and asserts that the user is successfully created in the database. - Uses `random_email()` and `random_lower_string()` functions to generate unique values for the email and password fields respectively. - Makes use of the `crud` module to retrieve the newly created user from the database after creation.
