- This method is asynchronous and takes a `loc_id` argument (Python linter warning about arguments being different can be ignored).
- It retrieves all locations using another asynchronous method called `get_all()`.
- The returned list of locations is accessed by its index equal to the provided `loc_id`, which is then returned from this method.
