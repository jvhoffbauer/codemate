- Defines an asynchronous generator function `asyncgen_state()` that takes a default argument of type `Dict[str, str]`, which is obtained using the `Depends()` decorator and passed to the `get_state()` function. - Inside the function body, it updates the value of the key `'/async'` in the dictionary `state`. - The `yield` statement returns the updated value of the key `'/async'` from the generator function, allowing other parts of the application to consume its output synchronously or asynchronously.
