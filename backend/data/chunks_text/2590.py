- This function defines a FastAPI web socket endpoint at `/ws`.
- It accepts a single argument, `websocket`, which is an instance of the built-in `WebSocket` class in Starlette.
- The function also takes an optional dependency, `value`, which is extracted from the HTTP connection using another function called `extract_value_from_http_connection`.
- After accepting the incoming websocket request, the function sends back the `value` to the client and then closes the websocket connection.
