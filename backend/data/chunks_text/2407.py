- Defines an asynchronous function `get_sync` that takes a dependency `state` of type `str`, provided by the `Depends()` decorator and its generator function `generator_state`. - Returns the value of the `state` dependency synchronously, without waiting for any async operations to complete. This is possible because the `state` dependency itself is not asynchronous (i.e., it's just a string).
