- This function tests a POST request to the "/sum" endpoint with a JSON payload of length `n`. - The `compress` parameter determines whether to enable GZIP compression for the request body using Python's built-in `gzip` module. - If compression is enabled, the `Content-Encoding` header is set to "gzip". - Regardless of compression, the `Content-Type` header is always set to "application/json". - After sending the request and receiving the response, the function asserts that the server correctly computed the sum of all elements in the input array (which should be `n*(n+1)/2`, assuming an integer overflow doesn't occur due to the small value of `n`) and returned it in the response body.
