- Defines an `async` function called `fetch_all` that takes a SQLAlchemy query object (`Select`, `Insert`, or `Update`) as its argument. - Uses the `engine` connection pool to create a new transaction and execute the given query using the `conn.execute()` method. - Retrieves all rows from the result set returned by the query using the `cursor.all()` method. - Converts each row into a dictionary of key-value pairs using the `_asdict()` method before returning them as a list.
