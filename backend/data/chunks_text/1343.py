- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items` that takes a positional argument `x_token`, which can be either a list of strings or `None`. The type and format of this parameter are specified using Pydantic's `Annotated` decorator, along with its position in the arguments (here, it is not required). - Uses another Pydantic feature called `Header()` to extract the value of the HTTP header named "X-Token" from the request. This value will be passed to the `x_token` parameter if provided by the client. - Returns a dictionary containing the extracted X-Token values, regardless of whether they were provided by the user or not.
