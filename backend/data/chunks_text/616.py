- This test case is part of the SQLModel tutorial (section 004).
- It imports and runs a specific function `main()` from that tutorial, which performs some database operations using SQLAlchemy's engine.
- The test uses pytest fixtures to clear any existing data in the SQLite database before running the tutorial function.
- It also patches the built-in print statement to capture its output during the execution of the tutorial function for testing purposes.
