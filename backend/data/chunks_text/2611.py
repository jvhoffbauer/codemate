- Defines a custom error handler for the `GET /items/{item_id}` endpoint using FastAPI's decorator syntax (@app.trace)
- The function takes an argument `item_id`, which is expected to be passed in the URL path (e.g., http://localhost:8000/items/abc123). This value will be available as a parameter when this function is called by FastAPI during an error handling scenario.
- Returns a JSON response with no content and a specific media type ("message/http"), indicating that this is not a regular API request but rather an error message being returned to the client.
