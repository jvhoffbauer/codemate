- Imports `test_tutorial002` function and `create_engine` function from SQLAlchemy library, and imports `expected_calls` list from somewhere else (not shown in this snippet). - Defines a variable called `mod` that contains the contents of the file `docs_src/tutorial/update.py`, which is assumed to be part of the project's documentation or tutorial section. This assumes that there exists such a directory structure within the project. - Sets the value of `mod.sqlite_url` to a string representing an SQLite database URL. - Creates an engine object using the `create_engine` function provided by SQLAlchemy, passing it the `mod.sqlite_url`. - Initializes a list called `calls` to store information about print statements made during execution. - Retrieves a mock version of the builtin `print` function using Python's unittest.mock module, and stores it in a variable named `new_print`. The `get_testing_print_function` method used here is not defined in this snippet; presumably it returns a mock object that records each call to `print` for later inspection. - Patches the original `print` function with the newly created mock object, so that all subsequent calls to `print` will instead invoke the mock object. - Calls the main entry point of the `docs_src/tutorial/update.py` script, stored in the `mod.main()` attribute. - Asserts that the recorded calls to `print` match the expected behavior, based on the `expected_calls` list mentioned earlier.
