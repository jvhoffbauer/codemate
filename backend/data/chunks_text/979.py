- Checks if a given `ModelField` (a field of a SQLAlchemy model) represents a sequential data structure, such as lists, tuples, or arrays. - Uses two methods to determine whether the field is sequential: checking its shape attribute and inspecting the annotation of its underlying Python type using a helper function `_annotation_is_sequence`. - The `# type: ignore[attr-defined]` comment disables a mypy warning about accessing an undefined attribute on the `ModelField` class, which is defined elsewhere but not imported here for simplicity.
