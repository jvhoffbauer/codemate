1. This function adds a new scheduling task using APScheduler library in Python. It takes two optional arguments `seconds` and `job_id`. The former specifies the loop interval time in seconds (default is 120 seconds). The latter is the unique identifier for the scheduled task.
2. If the specified job ID already exists, an error message will be returned. Otherwise, a new scheduling job with the given parameters will be added to the scheduler.
3. The `demo_task()` function is not shown here but it's assumed that this function performs some specific tasks as required by the user.
