- Defines a GET request for `/items/`.
- Uses FastAPI's dependency injection to pass in a query parameter (`q`) with validation constraints using Pydantic's `Annotated` and `Query` classes.
- If `q` is not `None`, it updates a dictionary called `results` with an additional key-value pair containing the value of `q`.
- Returns the updated `results` dictionary as JSON response.
