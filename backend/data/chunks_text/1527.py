- Defines a GET request for `/items/`.
- Uses FastAPI's dependency injection to pass query parameters as arguments to the function.
- Includes validation and constraints on the `q` parameter using Pydantic's `Annotated` decorator. The minimum length is set to 3 characters, maximum length to 50 characters, and the regular expression ensures that the value matches 'fixedquery'. If the constraint fails, an error will be raised by Pydantic during deserialization of the request body or query string.
