- Defines a function called `select` with four arguments (`__ent0`, `entity_1`, `__ent2`, and `entity_3`) of specific types (_TCCA_ and _TScalar_) using type annotations. - The first overloaded version returns a tuple containing two elements from each input sequence based on specified conditions defined by `entity_1` and `entity_3`. - This implementation is specifically for sequences that have nested container types (_TCCA_) as their elements.
