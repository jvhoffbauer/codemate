- Defines a `__repr__()` method for the class that returns a string representation of its instance.
- Retrieves the name of the dependency using the `getattr()` function and sets it to `attr`. If the dependency cannot be accessed (e.g., due to an error), falls back to returning the name of the dependency's type instead.
- Adds a string representing whether caching is enabled or not to the end of the string representation, depending on the value of the `use_cache` attribute. This allows users to easily see which instances are cached and which ones aren't when debugging their programs.
