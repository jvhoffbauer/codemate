- Retrieves a list of items owned by the currently authenticated user using FastAPI's `Security()` middleware to retrieve and validate the user object from the request context. - The `scopes` parameter is used to specify that this endpoint requires the 'items' scope in order for the user to access it. - Returns an array containing a single item with an ID of 'Foo' and the username of the owner (which should match the username of the currently authenticated user).
