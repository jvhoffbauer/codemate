- This function tests the `tutorial003_py310` module in the SQLAlchemy tutorial section using pytest's `clear_sqlmodel` fixture to clear any existing database connections. - It imports and sets up the necessary variables for running the module, including the URL of the SQLite database and a testing print function that captures output. - The `patch` decorator is used to replace Python's built-in `print` function with our custom one during the execution of the module, allowing us to capture its output and verify it matches what we expect.
