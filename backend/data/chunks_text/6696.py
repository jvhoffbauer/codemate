- Defines a middleware function `method_middleware()` that takes a context object as input and modifies it before passing control to the next middleware or endpoint handler. - Uses the `asyncio.Lock` decorator `nonlocal` to access global variables `_calls` and `method_middleware_var`. - Sets a value for `method_middleware_var`, which is likely used by other parts of the application. - Appends an entry with details about the request and response to a dictionary called `_calls`, using the IDs from both requests and responses. - Yields execution back to the caller, allowing other middlewares or endpoints to execute. - In a `finally` block, appends another entry to `_calls` with similar information but labeled as an exit instead of enter.
