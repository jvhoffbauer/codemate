- This function is an asynchronous method that takes in an exception and returns a dictionary representing the response to be sent back to the client. - It first tries to handle the exception using `handle_exception`, which may also raise another exception (in this case, it's caught by the `try` block). - If `handle_exception` raises a `BaseError`, its `get_resp()` method is called instead of raising the original exception again. - For `HTTPException`, we simply re-raise it since it already has a predefined response. - Any other exceptions are logged with their stack trace and replaced with a generic `InternalError`.
