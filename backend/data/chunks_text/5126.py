- Adds a new route `/validate` to the FastAPI router using the `cogValidateExtension` from GeoPandas' Cogeo library. - Tests if adding this extension correctly adds an additional route by comparing the length of the routes in two different routers, one without and another with the extension included. - Makes a GET request to the newly created route passing the URL of a COG file as a parameter, checks that the status code is 200, and verifies that the JSON response contains the expected key "COG".
