- This method is marked as deprecated with a warning message starting from version 0.0.14 of SQLModel library. - Instead of using this method to convert an object's state into a dictionary representation, it recommends using the `model_dump()` method provided by SQLModel for the same purpose. - The new method takes similar arguments like `include`, `exclude`, etc., and returns a dictionary containing the values of the object's attributes that satisfy the specified inclusion/exclusion criteria.
