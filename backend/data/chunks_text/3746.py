- Creates a temporary directory using `temp_path_factory` and sets it as the current working directory (CWD). - Defines a path for the SQLite database file in the temporary directory. - Checks if the database already exists, deletes it if so (skips this check on Windows due to coverage issues). - Imports the `main` module of the SQL application, which creates the Flask app and initializes the database schema. - Reloads the `main` module to ensure that any import side effects are executed again during each test run. - Yields a test client instance for use by other tests. - Deletes the database file at the end of the fixture's execution, unless it was deleted earlier because it existed before running the tests. - Restores the original CWD.
