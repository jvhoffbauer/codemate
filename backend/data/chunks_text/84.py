- Defines a function `any_` that takes an argument of either a SQLAlchemy column expression or a value, and returns a collection aggregate object representing the SQL `ANY()` function. - Imports the necessary functions from SQLAlchemy's `collection` module to create this aggregate object (not shown in provided snippet). - The `ignore[arg-type]` comment is used by mypy to suppress a warning about the type signature being too general for the `sqlalchemy.any_()` function; it indicates that we trust mypy's analysis but want to use this function anyway.
