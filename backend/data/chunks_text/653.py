- This function tests a specific tutorial in SQLModel's documentation using pytest fixtures to clear the database and set up necessary variables like `sqlite_url`. - The `create_engine()` method is used to connect to an SQLite database at the given URL, which will be used for testing purposes. - A mocking library called `mock` (specifically its `patch()` decorator) is used to replace Python's built-in print statement with a custom implementation that records all printed output into a list of strings called `expected_calls`. - After replacing the print statement, the main function of the tutorial being tested is executed within this modified context, allowing us to capture any console output generated by the program during execution. - Finally, we check whether the captured output matches our expectations by comparing it against another predefined list called `expected_calls`, which should contain all the statements that were supposed to be printed during normal operation.
