- Defines a GET route for retrieving information about unicorns with a specific name using FastAPI's decorator syntax (@app.get). - Uses path parameters ({} in URL) to pass the requested unicorn name to the function as an argument named 'name'. - Checks whether the passed name is equal to 'yolo', and raises a custom exception called `UnicornException` if it is, otherwise returns a dictionary containing the requested unicorn's name.
