- This function is a decorator that checks if certain email configuration settings are enabled before allowing emails to be sent from Celery tasks. - It takes three arguments: `cls`, which represents the class being decorated (in this case, likely a Celery task), `v`, which is not used in this implementation, and `values`, which contains the user's email configuration settings passed as keyword arguments when starting Celery workers or scheduling tasks. - The function returns True if all required email configuration settings are present, False otherwise.
