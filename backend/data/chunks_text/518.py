- This function tests a specific section of SQLAlchemy's documentation (tutorial004_py310 in connect.select). - It uses `clear_sqlmodel`, which is likely a fixture provided by pytest, to clear any existing data or state before running the test. - The function imports and executes the module being tested (`mod`) while capturing print statements using `get_testing_print_function`. - Finally, it checks that the captured prints match what was expected based on the implementation of `expected_calls`.
