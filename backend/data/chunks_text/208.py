- Defines a fixture named `session` using PyTest's built-in `fixture()` decorator. - Creates an instance of SQLAlchemy's `Engine`, specifying that it should use an in-memory database and disable thread safety checks for testing purposes. - Uses SQLModel to generate a metadata object representing our database schema, then creates the necessary tables within the engine. - Yields a new SQLAlchemy session object wrapped inside a context manager, which will be automatically closed after each test function has completed execution. This allows us to easily access a persistent database connection throughout our tests without having to manually manage its lifecycle or worry about concurrency issues.
