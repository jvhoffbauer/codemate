- This function tests the `POST /files/` endpoint of a FastAPI application using the `pytest` framework's built-in testing client (`TestClient`) to simulate HTTP requests and responses. - It creates two temporary files in memory using Python's `tempfile` module, writes some data into them, and passes their paths along with their filenames to the request body as multiple values for the same key ('files') using a tuple of tuples syntax. - The function then sends an HTTP POST request to the server with these files attached, parses the JSON response, and checks that it contains the expected size information for both uploaded files.
