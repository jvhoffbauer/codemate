- This function is connected to Celery's `@task_prerun` decorator using weak reference (`weak=False`) to ensure that it runs before the actual task execution. - It sets the current ID of the task being executed by storing it in a global variable called `celery_id`. If `use_internal_celery_task_id` is true, this ID will be the internal Celery task ID; otherwise, it will come from a separate function called `generator()`. - Additionally, it retrieves the parent ID of the task from the request headers (stored in a variable named `header_key`) and stores it in another global variable called `celery_parent_id`, as long as it actually exists.
