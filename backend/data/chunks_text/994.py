- This function takes an annotation (a type hint provided by a developer to help the interpreter understand what kind of value should be assigned to a variable) as input, and returns `True` if it's a sequence of scalar types (such as int, float, str), and `False` otherwise. - It first checks whether the annotation is a union type (i.e., can take multiple values). If so, it iterates over each argument of the union type and recursively calls itself with that argument until it finds one that satisfies the condition. - If the annotation isn't a union type, it simply checks whether it's a sequence type (like list or tuple) and whether all its elements are scalars using another helper function called `field_annotation_is_scalar`.
