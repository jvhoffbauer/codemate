- Tests asynchronous round trip functionality of `app.io.AIO` module for saving and loading data using a temporary file path provided by `tmp_path`. - Verifies that the saved file exists before performing save operation and checks if loaded results match with original content after successful load operation. - Uses keyword arguments to pass additional options during save operation (if any).
