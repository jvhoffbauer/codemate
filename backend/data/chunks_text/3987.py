- This test uses `pytest-mock` to simulate a REST API request with Pydantic as the data validation library.
- The YAML data is passed in the request body and deserialized into a dictionary using PyYAML.
- Pydantic validates the input against its schema definition and returns a JSON response containing the sanitized data.
