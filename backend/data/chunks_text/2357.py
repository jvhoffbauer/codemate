- Defines a GET request handler for the root path of level 4 in the API hierarchy using FastAPI's `@app.get()` decorator with custom router `@callback_router4`.
- Accepts a query parameter named 'level4' which is expected to be a string value representing some input or filter criteria at this level of the API.
- The function body currently contains an empty pass statement, indicating that no immediate action will be taken by this endpoint. This can be replaced with actual implementation logic as needed.
