1. This function handles the JSON-RPC request body and returns a dictionary containing the responses to each request. It takes several arguments including `http_request`, `background_tasks`, `sub_response`, and `body`. The latter can be either a single request object or a list of such objects representing multiple requests within a single JSON-RPC batch request.
2. The function first attempts to retrieve any shared dependencies required by all requests using the `self.solve_shared_dependencies()` method. If an exception is raised during this process, it's caught and stored in the `shared_dependencies_error` variable. Otherwise, the resulting cache is saved in `dependency_cache`.
3. A new scheduler instance is obtained from the entry point (presumably defined elsewhere). Each individual request is then submitted to the scheduler via its `spawn()` method, which runs them concurrently. Their results are added to a list called `job_list`. Finally, all jobs are waited on simultaneously using `asyncio.gather()`.
4. After collecting all responses, the function filters out empty ones that don't contain errors or IDs, and saves the remaining valid ones into another list named `resp_list`.
5. Depending on whether the original input was a single request or a list thereof, the final result is either a single response or a list of responses returned to the client.
