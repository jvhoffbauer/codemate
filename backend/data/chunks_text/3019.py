- Overrides `common_parameters` dependency with a custom implementation that returns a dictionary containing 'q' and 'bar' keys for any input value in `test_override_with_sub__main_depends_q_foo`. - Makes an HTTP GET request to '/main-depends?' endpoint with 'q=foo' query parameter using Flask Client. - Asserts that the status code of the response is 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and its JSON body contains a validation error indicating that the 'k' key is missing from the query parameters. - Resets the `app.dependency_overrides` dictionary after making the API call.
