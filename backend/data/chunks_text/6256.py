- Defines a function called `mocked_strptime_isoformat` that takes arguments and keyword arguments similar to those passed to `datetime.strptime()`.
- Inside this function, extracts the first argument (the date object) and second argument (the format string) from the arguments list.
- Returns an instance of `DateTimeStrpTime`, which is likely a custom class used for mocking purposes in this context.
