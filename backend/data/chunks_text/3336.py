- Tests if the OpenAPI schema can be retrieved successfully from the API endpoint "/openapi.json" using Flask's built-in testing client (TestClient). - Asserts that the HTTP status code of the response is 200, indicating a successful request. - Compares the JSON content of the response with the predefined `openapi_schema`, which should match since they are both representing the same specification for the API endpoints and their parameters/responses.
