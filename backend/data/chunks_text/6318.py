- This function generates a JWT (JSON Web Token) access token that can be used to authenticate subsequent API calls. - It takes two dependencies as arguments: `AsyncSession` from SQLAlchemy and `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm`, which contains the username and password provided by the client in the request body. - The function retrieves the user with the given email address from the database using SQLAlchemy's `select()`. If the user doesn't exist, it raises a `HTTPException` with status code 400 ("Bad Request"). - The function checks whether the hashed password of the user matches the plaintext password provided by the client. If they don't match, another `HTTPException` is raised with status code 400. - Finally, the function returns the generated access token response containing the user ID as payload.
