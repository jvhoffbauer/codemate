- Defines a function `fail` that takes in an instance of FastAPI's response object (`Resp`) as its argument and returns another response object (`Response`) using JSON format. - The returned response contains two key-value pairs representing the HTTP status code and error message respectively, which are extracted from the input `Resp`. - This function can be used to handle failed requests or errors by returning customized responses instead of default ones provided by FastAPI.
