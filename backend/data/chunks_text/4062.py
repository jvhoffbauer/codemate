- This function tests a POST request to create a new item with given title and size using Flask's built-in `client`.
- The expected status code is checked against the actual one returned by the server. If they don't match, an error message containing both codes and responses is printed for debugging purposes.
- After verifying that the HTTP response was successful (i.e., status code 200), we check whether the JSON body of the response matches our input data.
