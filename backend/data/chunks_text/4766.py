- Defines an asynchronous function `get_model_c` that returns a new instance of class `ModelC`. - The constructor arguments for `ModelC` are hardcoded to "test-user" and "test-password". This could be replaced with environment variables or configuration files, but this implementation assumes these values will not change frequently.
