- Defines an asynchronous function `get3` with a single parameter `foo`, which is annotated with both `Annotated` and `Query`. The `Annotated` decorator specifies that the value of this argument should be validated against the constraints defined by the `Query` decorator (in this case, a minimum length of 1). - Uses the `Depends` decorator to inject a dependency into the function's context, in this case `dep`. This allows us to reuse common dependencies across multiple functions without repeating their definitions. - Includes a docstring for the function, but it has been marked as "no coverage" using the `pragma: nocover` directive. This means that we don't expect this function body to actually execute during testing or profiling, since its purpose is purely to define the signature and parameters of the function.
