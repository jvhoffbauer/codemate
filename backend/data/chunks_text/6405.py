- Defines a class method `get_error_model` that returns an error model for the current class instance. - Checks whether the error model has already been defined in the class dictionary, and returns it if found. - If the error model hasn't been defined yet, builds it using another method (presumably `build_error_model`) and stores it in the class dictionary before returning it.
