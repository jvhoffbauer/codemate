- Defines a method `get_route_handler` that returns a callable function for handling requests based on defined routes in FastAPI. - Creates a new function called `custom_route_handler`, which wraps the original route handler (obtained from parent class). - Inside the wrapper function, catches `RequestValidationError` exceptions thrown by the original route handler and converts them into an HTTP exception with status code 422 ("Unprocessable Entity") and detailed error message containing validation errors and request body data.
