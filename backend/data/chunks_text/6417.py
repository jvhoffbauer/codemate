- Defines a nested `_ErrorResponseModel` subclass of `BaseModel`, which is used to represent JSON RPC errors in responses. - The component name follows the convention `_ErrorResponse[<model_name>]`. - The module attribute is set to the current module using string formatting with f-strings. - The `jsonrpc` field represents the version number (2.0) and includes an example value for documentation purposes. - The `id` field can be either a string or integer, but defaults to None. - The `error` field contains another nested model representing the specific error details. - The `model_config` attribute sets the validation behavior to 'forbid', meaning that all required fields must be present in the input data.
