- Defines a method called `handle_exception` that takes an exception (exc) as its argument and returns a dictionary. - The implementation of this method raises the same exception passed to it, effectively propagating the error up the call stack without any handling or modification. This is likely used in situations where customized error handling is required at higher levels of the application's architecture, but for some reason, this specific function doesn't need to provide such functionality. By raising the original exception instead of wrapping it with additional context or details, downstream components can still access the original error message and traceback information.
