- This function, named `_openapi_compatible`, takes a dictionary called 'value' as an argument and returns it after making some modifications. - The function checks if the version of OpenAPI specified by the 'value' dictionary is compatible with the versions supported by this library using the `supported_openapi_versions` variable from the `packaging.version` module. If not, it raises an AssertionError exception. - After checking compatibility, the function updates the 'value' dictionary to replace the 'openapi' key with a wildcard pattern represented by the Any type (ANY) provided by Pytest-mock.
