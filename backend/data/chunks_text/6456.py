- This function handles incoming HTTP requests and returns a response using FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` feature to execute long-running tasks in parallel with request handling. - It creates a new instance of `BackgroundTasks`, which is used to manage background tasks. - The function parses the request body (if present), and passes it along with other arguments to two helper functions `handle_body` and `parse_body`. - If an exception occurs during request processing or body parsing, the function calls another helper function `handle_exception_to_resp` to convert the exception into a proper HTTP response. - Otherwise, the function executes the main request handler `handle_body`, passing along the parsed body, a reference to the current request object, and the `BackgroundTasks` instance. - After handling the request, the function combines headers from both the original and secondary responses, sets the status code (if necessary), and returns the final response.
