- This function is called `check_jwt_token`. It takes an optional argument `token`, which represents a login token and defaults to None. The `description` attribute specifies that this parameter should be used for logging in. - If the header of the request contains a field named "login_token", it will automatically extract its value as the `token` parameter. Alternatively, you can specify an alternative name using the `alias` keyword argument. For example, if your API uses the HTTP header `X-Token` instead of `Authorization`, you could pass `alias="X-Token"` to the `Header` decorator. - The function attempts to decode the JWT token using the secret key specified in the `settings.py` file. If the token has expired or there are any other errors during decoding, appropriate exceptions are raised. Otherwise, the decoded payload is returned.
