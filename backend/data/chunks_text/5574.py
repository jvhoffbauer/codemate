- This method takes a dictionary `data` as input and returns a list of binary expressions that will be used to filter database records based on the key-value pairs provided in `data`. - It iterates over each key-value pair in `data`, retrieves the corresponding SQL field from a predefined mapping (`self._filter_entities`) using the key, parses the value according to its Python type (using an internal helper function), and creates a binary expression by calling one of the comparison operators available on the SQL field with the parsed values. - The resulting list of binary expressions is returned at the end.
