- This test case is using `pytest` to run and verify SQLAlchemy's `SQLModel` ORM in Python 3.10 mode. - It imports a specific module (`docs_src.tutorial.one`) containing an example of how to use `SQLModel`, which includes creating a database connection, defining models, executing queries, and handling errors. - The test creates a new `Session` instance and adds a new hero record to it, then commits the changes. - It sets up mock printing functionality to capture output from the `select_heroes()` method, which should print out a list of heroes retrieved from the database. - Finally, it runs the `select_heroes()` method and checks that the correct output was printed by comparing against expected results stored in a list.
