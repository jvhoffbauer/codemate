- This function is a Starlette event listener that executes when the application starts up (i.e., on "startup"). - It asynchronously connects to the specified database using the `database` object, which presumably has been configured elsewhere in the app's setup logic. - The purpose of this connection is likely to establish an active session with the database for use by other parts of the application during its runtime.
