- This function retrieves the currently authenticated and authorized user using FastAPI's `Security()` decorator with the `get_current_user()` callback function to obtain the user object from the request context. - The function checks whether the user is disabled (i.e., has been deactivated) by querying their `disabled` attribute. If so, it raises a custom HTTP exception with status code 400 ("Bad Request") and an error message explaining that the user is inactive. - Otherwise, the function returns the active user as is.
