- Defines an asynchronous context manager using `@asynccontextmanager`.
- Initializes a dictionary called `ml_models` to store machine learning (ML) models.
- Assigns a specific ML model named "answer_to_everything" to the `ml_models` dictionary.
- Yields control back to the caller, allowing other parts of the application to execute before returning to this function.
- Cleans up the `ml_models` dictionary by clearing it at the end of the function's execution. This releases any associated resources used by the ML models.
