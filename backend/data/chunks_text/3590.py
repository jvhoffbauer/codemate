- Returns a `Model2` object with specific fields included from its nested `Model1` and `ref` objects using the `response_model_include` parameter in FastAPI's route decorator. - The `...` placeholder in the `response_model_include` dictionary is replaced by the corresponding field names of the nested objects to include. - This feature allows for more fine-grained control over which data is returned in responses, reducing unnecessary network traffic and improving performance.
