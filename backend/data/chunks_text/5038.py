- This function defines a custom management command that launches an interactive Python shell with access to Django models and built-in profiling tools like `cProfile`.
- The shell is launched by calling `embed()`, which imports necessary modules (IPython, Django apps, etc.) and creates a dictionary of variables (`ctx`) containing the imported objects as well as any additional items specified here (like `models`).
- The `banner2` parameter is used to suppress the default banner message displayed when launching the shell, while `colors` specifies the color scheme to use.
- Finally, the shell is launched with the `using` parameter set to 'asyncio', indicating that it should be run asynchronously rather than synchronously.
