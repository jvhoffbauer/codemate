- Defines a function `inner()` that creates an empty list called `events`, and saves references to two methods of the Sentry client's transport object (`old_capture_event` and `old_capture_envelope`) before replacing them with custom functions `append_event` and `append_envelope`.
- The `append_event` function adds each event passed to it to the `events` list, then calls the original `capture_event` method with the same argument. This ensures that all events are still captured by Sentry as usual.
- Similarly, the `append_envelope` function iterates over the items in the envelope passed to it, checks whether they represent events or transactions, and captures their payloads separately using the original `capture_event` method. Again, this is done so that these items can be accessed later without interfering with normal Sentry behavior.
- Finally, the `monkeypatch` module from Python's unittest library is used to replace the original `capture_event` and `capture_envelope` methods with our custom versions during the execution of `inner()`. Afterwards, we restore the originals using `setattr()`.
