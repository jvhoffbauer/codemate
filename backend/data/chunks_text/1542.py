- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()` that takes a single argument `q`, which is annotated with both `Query()` and `List[str]`. This means it can be passed either a list of strings or a string (which will be interpreted as a search query). - The function returns a dictionary called `query_items` containing a key `"q"` whose value is the input parameter `q`. This dictionary will be used to construct the query for fetching items from some data store, such as a database or API endpoint.
