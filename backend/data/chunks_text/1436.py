- This endpoint retrieves a specific item with the given ID from the application's database (represented by `fake_db`) using FastAPI's built-in dependency injection mechanism to pass the item ID and an optional authentication token as arguments to the function. - The `response_model` parameter is used to specify that the returned value should be serialized according to the `Item` model defined earlier. - If the provided authentication token doesn't match the expected secret key (stored in `fake_secret_token`), a customized error message is raised with status code 400 ("Bad Request"). - If the requested item isn't present in the database, another customized error message is raised with status code 404 ("Not Found").
