- This function is a unit test for the main route of an application using Flask's built-in testing client (client). - It makes a GET request to the root URL ("/"), and asserts that the status code returned by the server is 200 OK. If not, it displays the error message along with the text content received from the server. - The second assertion checks if the HTML document type declaration (doctype) is present in the HTTP response body.
