- Tests if an exception is raised when accessing `/async_raise_other`, which depends on a missing dependency (`OtherDependency`) using `pytest.raises()`. - Asserts that the expected message ("asyncgen raise not started") is displayed before raising the exception, and checks that the endpoint's status is still pending. - After raising the exception, asserts that the expected message ("asyncgen raise finalized") is displayed and verifies that the endpoint's status has been updated to error.
