- Initializes a new instance of the class with an AdminApp object and a SQLAlchemy engine.
- Checks that both arguments are provided and raises an AssertionError otherwise.
- Sets the `app`, `engine`, `amis_parser`, `parser`, and `schema_model` attributes based on the input parameters.
- Retrieves the list display fields from the parser and filters them to exclude any fields marked as `save=False`. This list is used for listing purposes.
- Determines the list filter fields by combining the existing list filter (if present) with the remaining searchable fields (excluding those already included in the list display).
- Calls the parent constructor of SqlalchemyCrud to initialize common crud functionality.
- Adds the list display fields to the `fields` attribute.
- Initializes the base ActionAdmin class with the AdminApp object.
