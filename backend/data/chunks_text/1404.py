- Defines a custom exception handler for `RequestValidationError`, which is raised by FastAPI's built-in validators when request data fails to meet specified constraints. - Returns a JSON response with HTTP status code 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and an error message containing both the validation errors and the original request body. This allows clients to easily identify and correct invalid input without having to make multiple requests or parse server logs.
