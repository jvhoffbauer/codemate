- Generates an OpenAPI (Swagger) JSON schema for a FastAPI application using Pytest and TestClient to make requests and verify responses. - The `@needs_py310` decorator ensures that Python version 3.10 is required to run this test case. - Defines a function called `test_openapi_schema` which imports the necessary classes from the `docs_src.header_params.tutorial002_py310` module of our FastAPI application. - Creates a TestClient instance with our FastAPI application as its argument. - Makes a GET request to the '/openapi.json' endpoint and verifies that it returns a status code of 200. - Asserts that the returned JSON matches the expected structure defined in the `response.json()` variable. - Includes a header parameter named'strange_header', which can be either a string or null, and defines its properties such as name, location ('header'), and required flag.
