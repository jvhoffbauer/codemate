- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()` that takes two arguments `q` and `item_id`.
- If a query string (`q`) is provided, it updates a dictionary called `results` with the key 'q' and its corresponding value.
- The function returns the updated `results` dictionary which includes either just the `item_id`, or both `item_id` and `q` depending on whether they were passed in as arguments.
