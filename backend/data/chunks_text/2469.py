- This endpoint returns a list of `Item` objects with invalid JSON data in one of the items, causing deserialization errors when consuming this API using clients that rely on strict JSON parsing (e.g., Python's built-in json module). - The `response_model` decorator is used to specify the expected schema for the returned value, which helps catch such issues at compile time instead of runtime. - By providing an example of how to use FastAPI's type hinting and validation features, developers can write more robust APIs that are easier to consume by third parties while also reducing the likelihood of unexpected behavior or bugs due to incorrect input handling.
