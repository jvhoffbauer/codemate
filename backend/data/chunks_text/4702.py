- Tests uploading a large file using FastAPI's built-in `Files` parameter and Pydantic's validation for maximum size of 64KB by default. - Creates a temporary directory and writes a byte stream to it that exceeds the default limit. - Makes an HTTP POST request to the server endpoint "/files/" passing the created file object in the `Files` dictionary. - Asserts that the status code is 200 OK and checks if the returned JSON contains the correct value for the 'file_size'.
