- This function takes an `HTTPConnection` object as input and returns a value stored in its associated application state using the `State` class provided by Starlette framework's ORM (Object Relational Mapping). - The returned value is accessed through the `app` attribute of the connection, which represents the current application instance, followed by accessing the `state` dictionary to retrieve the desired value. - Since this function is marked with the `async` decorator, it can be awaited inside other async functions or coroutines for efficient concurrent execution.
