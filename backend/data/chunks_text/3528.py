- Defines a GET request for items with an ID parameter passed as a list (multiple IDs can be provided) using FastAPI's decorator syntax (@app.get). - The function body is currently empty, but will contain logic to retrieve and return item data based on the specified ID(s). - This endpoint is not covered by unit tests due to its current implementation being incomplete or unnecessary.
