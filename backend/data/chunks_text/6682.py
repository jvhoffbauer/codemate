- Defines a function `ep` that takes an endpoint path as input and returns an instance of `jsonrpc.Entrypoint`.
- Initializes two counter variables with default values (zero).
- Defines two decorator functions `get_shared_counter` and `get_common_counter`, which increment their respective counters when called using `nonlocal`.
- Passes these decorators to `Dependencies` and `CommonDependencies` arguments of `Entrypoint` constructor.
- Registers a method named `probe` on the entrypoint object, taking dependency inputs from both decorators.
- Returns the created entrypoint object at the end.
