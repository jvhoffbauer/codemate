- Defines a decorator `reject_none` that takes a class as an argument (`cls`) and a list of field names (`"name"`, `"secret_name"`, `"age"`) as arguments. - Inside the function body, it defines an assert statement to check if the value passed in for validation is not null or empty. If it's none, then raise an exception with an error message. - Finally, it returns the validated value. This decorator can be used on any model fields to ensure they are never set to `None`.
