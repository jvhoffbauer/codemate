- This function is a GET request handler for retrieving an item with the specified ID from the database (represented by `fake_items_db`) using FastAPI's built-in dependency injection mechanism to pass the item ID as a parameter. - If the requested item is not present in the database, it raises a customized HTTP exception with status code 404 and error message "Item not found". - The response contains the name of the item and its unique identifier (ID).
