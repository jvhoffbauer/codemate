- This function tests the `tutorial002` module in the SQLAlchemy tutorial section using pytest's `clear_sqlmodel` fixture to clear any existing database connections. - It imports and sets up the necessary variables for running the `tutorial002` module, including creating a new engine instance. - It creates a mock print function (using `get_testing_print_function`) that captures all printed output during execution of the module, which is stored in the `calls` list. - The mock print function is then patched into the builtin `print` function before executing the module, allowing us to capture its output without actually printing it to the console. - Finally, we check if the captured output matches our expected output by comparing the contents of the `calls` list against an array of expected outputs (stored in the `expected_calls` variable).
