- Defines a function `get_client()` that imports and returns an instance of Flask's test client for the application defined in `docs_src/dependencies/tutorial001_py310`.
- The imported module is named `app`, which suggests it contains a Flask application object.
- This function can be used to easily create a test client for this specific application, without having to repeatedly import and instantiate it elsewhere in tests or other parts of the project.
