- This function is a validator that can be used with Pydantic's `@validators` decorator to validate and transform data during model instantiation or update. - It takes three arguments: the name of the field being validated (`field`), the value being assigned to it (`v`), and a dictionary containing all other fields being updated at once (`values`). - If the value passed as `v` is already an instance of the `URL` class, this function simply returns it unchanged. Otherwise, it creates a new `URL` object using any non-null values from the `values` dictionary as query parameters.
