- Defines an async function `create_files` that takes a list of byte arrays (representing multiple files) as its argument and returns a dictionary with keys "file_sizes" containing the length of each file passed to it. - Uses Pydantic's `File` class to validate input arguments, specifying that at least one file is required using the `List` type hint. - The returned dictionary can be used to store metadata about the uploaded files, such as their sizes or names.
