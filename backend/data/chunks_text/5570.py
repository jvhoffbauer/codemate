- This function takes two arguments `sel` and `link_clause`. The first argument is an instance of `Select`, which represents a SQL query. It's passed in as a dependency using FastAPI's `Depends()` decorator to retrieve it from another method called `get_select()`. - If the second argument `link_clause` is provided (it defaults to `None`), then we append its condition to the existing selection criteria using the `where()` method of the `Select` object. - Finally, we return the modified selection statement.
