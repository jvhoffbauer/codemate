- This function defines a GET request to retrieve public APIs using FastAPI's built-in router decorator `@router.get`.
- The returned data is modeled as an instance of `PublicAPISResponse`, which is defined elsewhere in the application.
- The actual API call is made using the `Client` class from the OpenAI library, and the result is passed back synchronously via `await`.
