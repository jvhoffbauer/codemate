- Imports a function `client` from a module called `tutorial001_py310`. This is likely part of some testing framework or library for Python 3.10 dependency management. - Makes an HTTP GET request to the URL "/users/" using the imported `client` object. - Asserts that the status code returned by the server is 200 (OK), and if not, prints out the text response instead. - Extracts the JSON data returned by the server and asserts that it contains specific keys ("message" and "params"). The value of "params" should be a dictionary with default values for "q", "skip", and "limit".
