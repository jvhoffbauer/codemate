- This function is a FastAPI endpoint with an `@app.post` decorator, which handles POST requests to the URL path "/uploadfiles/"
- The input parameter `files` is annotated using Pydantic's `Annotated` class and has two arguments: `list[UploadFile]` (a list of `UploadFile` objects) and `File(description="Multiple files as UploadFile")` (an optional description).
- Inside the function body, we extract the filenames from each uploaded file using a list comprehension and return them as a dictionary with the key "filenames".
