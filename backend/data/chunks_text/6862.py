- Creates a new user with a randomly generated email and password using `random_lower_string()` and `random_email()`. - Sets the `is_superuser` flag to True for this user. - Uses the `crud.user.create()` function from FastAPI's built-in CRUD operations to create the new user in the database. - Retrieves the newly created user by ID using `crud.user.get()`, and asserts that it exists (i.e., is not null). - Compares the email of the retrieved user with the email of the original user, and asserts they are equal. - Converts both users into JSON format using `jsonable_encoder()`, and asserts that their encoded representations are equivalent.
