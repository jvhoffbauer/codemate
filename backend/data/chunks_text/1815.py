- Defines an asynchronous function `get()` that returns a response object of type `HTMLResponse`. - The `HTMLResponse` class is provided by FastAPI's built-in templating engine, Jinja2. - Inside this function, we pass our predefined HTML string (`html`) to the constructor of `HTMLResponse`, which creates and returns a new response object with the given content.
