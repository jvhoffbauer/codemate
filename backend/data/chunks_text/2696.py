- Defines a function called `response_model_none_annotation_return_dict_with_extra_data` that returns an instance of the `User` class (presumably defined elsewhere) with a dictionary as its value instead of initializing it directly. - The returned dictionary contains three key-value pairs representing the user's name, surname, and password hash respectively. - Note that there is no `None` type annotation on the function's return type, but rather a custom `User` class which may or may not be derived from Python's built-in `dict`. This could indicate that the function is returning more data than just what's explicitly listed in the dictionary, potentially including attributes inherited from the parent class.
