- Defines an abstract method called `__call__` for a class using the `@abc.abstractmethod` decorator. - The method takes in an argument of type `ImageData`, applies an algorithm to it, and returns another instance of `ImageData`. - This is likely used as part of a larger image processing pipeline or library where each step can be represented by its own object that implements this interface.
