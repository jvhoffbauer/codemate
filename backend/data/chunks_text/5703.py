- Defines a `route()` function that takes three arguments: a `Request`, an ID for a specific link using `IdStrQuery`, and a list of IDs for items to be deleted from using `self.pk_admin.AnnotatedItemIdList`. - Checks whether the user has permission to update links using `await self.pk_admin.has_update_permission()`. If they don't have permission, returns an error message. - Creates a SQL statement with two WHERE clauses: one filtering by the specified link IDs, and another filtering by the specified item IDs. - Executes the SQL statement using `await self.pk_admin.db.async_execute()` and returns the number of rows affected as JSON data in the response body.
