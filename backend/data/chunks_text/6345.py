- Retrieves or creates a user with a specific email and password hash from the database using SQLAlchemy's `select`, `scalars`, and `add` methods. The user ID is also set to a predefined value for testing purposes. - Returns the retrieved/created user object for use in other tests that require a default user. - Uses PyTest AsyncIO fixtures to ensure proper test isolation and cleanup of resources.
