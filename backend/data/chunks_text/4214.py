- This function tests sending a notification using Flask-Mail and Celery Beat by simulating a POST request to the `/send-notification` endpoint with an email address and query parameter. - The `TestClient` class is used to make requests against the application's WSGI interface without starting it up. - A temporary file named 'log.txt' is created to store the output of the background task that sends the email. - After making the request, the status code and JSON response are checked for correctness. - Finally, the contents of the 'log.txt' file are read and compared against expected output.
