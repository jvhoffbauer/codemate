- This function is a dependency for obtaining an access token using OAuth2 authentication with a password grant type. - It takes in a `form_data` argument of type `Annotated[OAuth2PasswordRequestForm, Depends()]`, which is used to extract the username and password from the request body. - The function authenticates the user by calling `authenticate_user(fake_users_db, form_data.username, form_data.password)`. If the user doesn't exist or the credentials are incorrect, it raises a `HTTPException` with status code 400 (Bad Request). - If the user exists, it creates an access token with an expiration time of `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` minutes using `create_access_token()`. The token contains the sub (subject) as the username and scopes as specified in the request body. - Finally, the function returns a dictionary containing the access token and its corresponding token type ("Bearer").
