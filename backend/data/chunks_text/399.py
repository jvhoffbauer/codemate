- This function tests the JSON schema generation for a flat model using Pydantic version 1.
- The `assert` statement checks if the generated schema matches the expected structure and properties, including the definition of an enum type (`MyEnum1`) referenced in the `enum_field`.
- The resulting schema is returned as a dictionary with specific keys and values that conform to the OpenAPI Specification format.
