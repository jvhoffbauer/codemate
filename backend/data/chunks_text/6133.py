- Defines a `UserCrud` object with an excluded field (`username`) during updates using SQLAlchemy and Pydantic's `SqlalchemyCrud`. - Registers the crud object as a router under the prefix `/user`. - Includes the registered router into the main application. - Tests that the OpenAPI schema correctly excludes the `username` field from the update request body. - Tests that attempting to update the excluded field results in an error response, while successfully updating another field is allowed.
