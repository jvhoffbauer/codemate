- Tests uploading a file without an authentication token (i.e., missing `token` parameter in request body), expecting a HTTP status code of 422 and a validation error message containing details about both missing parameters. - Uses PyTest's `tmp_path` fixture to generate a temporary directory for storing the test file. - Utilizes FastAPI's built-in testing client to simulate sending requests to the server. - Asserts that the expected HTTP status code is returned by the server and checks the contents of the JSON response against a schema defined using Pytest-Mako's `IsDict` helper function.
