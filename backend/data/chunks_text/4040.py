- Tests incorrect Content-Type headers for item creation request and verifies that appropriate error messages are returned by FastAPI's built-in validation system using Pytest and Pydantic. - The first two tests use non-standard Content-Types ("text/plain" and "application/geo+json-seq") which trigger the `ModelAttributesError`, while the third test uses an invalid JSON format ("application/not-really-json"). In all cases, the expected error message is verified using Pytest fixtures (`IsDict`) and helper functions (`match_pydantic_error_url`).
