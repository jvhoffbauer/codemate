- Defines a class method named `_validate` that takes two arguments (`__input_value` and `_`) but ignores the second one.
- The function returns a string representation of its first argument using Python's built-in `str()` function.
- If the `email-validator` package is not installed, it logs a warning message to the console with instructions on how to install it. This functionality provides fallback behavior for cases where additional packages are required by the application but have not been installed yet.
