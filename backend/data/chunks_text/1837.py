- Defines an asynchronous function called `websocket_endpoint` that takes a WebSocket object (`websocket`) and two optional arguments: `item_id`, which represents the ID of the item being viewed by the client, and `q`, which is a query parameter passed in the URL. - The `Depends` decorator is used to pass the `cookie_or_token` argument from another function called `get_cookie_or_token`. This allows us to authenticate users without having to repeat the authentication logic in this function. - Inside the loop, we receive a message from the client using `await websocket.receive_text()`. We then send back some information about the session state, including the value of either the cookie or the query token, depending on whether it's been provided. If the `q` parameter has been set, we also include its value. Finally, we send back the original message received from the client along with the item ID.
