- Initializes a SQLModel instance using either Pydantic validation or SQLAlchemy table construction based on whether the class is derived from SQLModel or not. - Copies the current `__dict__` of the instance to preserve any existing attributes that should be merged with the new ones. - Calls either the Pydantic validator or the SQLAlchemy table constructor depending on the type of model being initialized. - Merges the updated dictionary back into the original one to avoid overwriting existing attributes.
