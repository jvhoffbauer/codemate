- Creates a factory function named `apiroute_factory` that takes an optional dictionary as its argument (representing the environment). - Defines a new subclass of `APIRoute`, named `EnvAPIRoute`, inside this function. - Sets the configuration attribute of the `EnvAPIRoute` object using either the passed environment or an empty dictionary if no environment was provided. - Overrides the `get_route_handler` method of the parent class `APIRoute`. - Wraps the original handler returned by `super().get_route_handler()` into a coroutine that sets up the RasterIO environment using the stored configuration.
