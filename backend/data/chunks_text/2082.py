- This function, named `_get_client_tag`, takes an optional query parameter called `client_id`. If it's not provided (i.e., `Query(None)`), it returns `None`. Otherwise, it concatenates the `client_id` with "_tag" and returns that string as a result.
- The underscore (_) before "tag" in the returned string seems to indicate some sort of internal or private usage for this tag value. It could be used by other parts of the application to identify resources associated with a specific client ID. However, without further context about how this function is being used, it's difficult to say exactly what its purpose is.
