- This endpoint returns a dictionary with two key-value pairs representing a person's name and surname without using any response model or annotations. - The `@app.get()` decorator is used to define a GET request for this endpoint, which has no parameters (hence the empty parentheses). - The function body simply creates a dictionary containing the desired data and returns it directly.
