- This function is an asynchronous method called when a request is made to the server. - It retrieves an API key from the query parameters using the name of the model (presumably defined elsewhere). - If no API key is provided and auto_error is True, it raises a HTTPException with a forbidden status code and error message. - Otherwise, it returns the API key or None if none was provided.
