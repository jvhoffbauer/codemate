- Defines a fixture named `normal_user_token_headers`, scoped to the module level, using PyTest's built-in `fixture()` decorator. - The function returns an object called `authentication_token_from_email`, which takes in an email address (here, `config.EMAIL_TEST_USER`) and generates an authorization token for that user. - This fixture can be used in tests within this module by calling it without arguments; its value will be automatically passed as request headers with each test request made via Flask's testing client.
