- This function tests a specific tutorial (`tutorial001`) in the SQLModel documentation by running it and checking that certain print statements are called. - The `clear_sqlmodel` parameter is used to clear any existing database connections before running the tutorial, ensuring a clean environment for testing. - The `get_testing_print_function` method is used to capture all printed output during the execution of the tutorial, which can then be checked against expected values using the `assert` statement at the end.
