- Defines an asynchronous function `context_b` that takes a keyword argument `state`, which is obtained using the `Depends()` decorator and passed to it by `context_a`. - Inside this function, we set the value of the key 'context_b' in the dictionary `state` to'started b'. - We use the `yield from` statement to pass control back to the caller until the end of the function block. During this time, other functions can access the modified values of `state`. - After returning from the function, we again modify the value of the key 'context_b' in the dictionary `state` and append the current value of 'context_a' to it. This updated value will be available when `context_b` is called next time.
