- This test case uses `unittest.mock` to mock out the builtin print function and capture its output using a custom testing print function provided by SQLAlchemy's `get_testing_print_function`.
- The test creates an instance of the module being tested (`mod`) and sets up necessary variables such as the SQLite URL and engine connection string. It also initializes an empty list called `calls` which will hold the captured print statements.
- Inside the context manager created by `with patch("builtins.print", new=new_print)`, the main method of the module is executed.
- After executing the main method, the test checks if the correct data was printed by comparing the contents of the `calls` list against the expected values.
- Finally, the test retrieves all indexes defined on the `Hero` table using SQLAlchemy's `Inspector` class and compares them against the expected set of indexes. If any unexpected indexes are found or missing ones exist, the test fails.
