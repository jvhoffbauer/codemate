- Defines an asynchronous context manager called `method_middleware` using the `@contextlib.asynccontextmanager` decorator. - Sets a global variable `method_middleware_var` to a value inside the context manager. - Keeps track of requests and responses in a dictionary called `_calls`. - Appends information about entering and exiting this middleware to the corresponding request/response pair in `_calls`. - Yields control back to the caller within a `try...finally` block that adds exit information to `_calls`.
