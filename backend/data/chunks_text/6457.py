- Defines a function `handle_body()` that takes several arguments related to HTTP requests and responses, as well as some additional parameters like `background_tasks`. - Inside this function, it first tries to retrieve some shared dependencies using the `self.entrypoint.solve_shared_dependencies()` method. If an exception is raised during this process (e.g., due to missing required inputs), it sets the `shared_dependencies_error` variable accordingly. Otherwise, it stores the result in the `dependency_cache` variable. - The main logic of handling the request/response is then executed inside another function called `handle_req_to_resp()`, which also receives most of the same arguments plus two new ones: `dependency_cache` and `shared_dependencies_error`. This function returns the final JSON-RPC response object. - After executing `handle_req_to_resp()`, the function checks whether there's any content in the resulting response by checking if certain keys ("error" or "id") are present. If no content was returned, it raises a custom exception named `NoContent`.
