- Creates two `Hero` objects and adds them to a SQLAlchemy session using Flask-SQLAlchemy's ORM.
- Commits changes made in the session to the database.
- Makes an HTTP GET request to the "/heroes/" endpoint of a Flask app with Pytest-Flask integration testing.
- Retrieves JSON response from the server and asserts that it has status code 200 (OK).
- Asserts that the length of the response body is equal to the number of heroes added earlier.
- Extracts specific fields from each hero object and checks if they match their corresponding values in the JSON response.
- Also extracts the ID field generated by SQLAlchemy for both heroes and verifies its presence in the JSON response.
