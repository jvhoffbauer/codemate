- Defines a function `gdal_env()` that takes an optional argument `disable_read`.
- The default value of `disable_read` is set using the `Query` decorator, which allows for type hinting and validation.
- Inside the function, a dictionary called `gdal_env` is created with a single key-value pair representing an environment variable to be passed to GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library).
- The value of this environment variable is set based on the value of `disable_read`, converted to uppercase using the `upper()` method.
