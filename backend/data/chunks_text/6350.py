- This function tests deleting a current user using FastAPI's built-in testing framework and SQLAlchemy for database operations. - It sends a DELETE request to the `/delete_current_user` endpoint with the authentication header containing the JWT token of the logged-in user (stored in `default_user_headers`) obtained from the login function. - The function checks that the server returns an empty response (HTTP status code 204) after successfully deleting the user. - Finally, it retrieves the deleted user from the database using SQLAlchemy and asserts that there are no results returned by the query.
