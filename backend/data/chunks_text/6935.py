- Creates a new SQLAlchemy database session using `SessionLocal()`.
- Uses an asynchronous context manager to automatically close the session after it's used in a block of code (yielded).
- Allows multiple concurrent requests to use their own separate sessions, improving scalability and reducing contention issues.
