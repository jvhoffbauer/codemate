- This function takes a `ModelField` object as an argument and returns a dictionary containing additional JSON schema properties for that field based on its metadata. - The returned dictionary is either the value of the `json_schema_extra` attribute of the field's metadata (if it exists), or an empty dictionary if no such attribute is present. - This function can be used to add custom validation rules or other metadata to specific fields in a model without modifying the underlying SQLAlchemy definitions.
