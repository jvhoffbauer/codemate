- This test checks if a FastAPIError is raised when trying to access an invalid response model in Python version 3.10 (Python 3.9 and below are not affected). - The `needs_py310` decorator ensures that this test is skipped on older versions of Python, as the new syntax for defining custom JSON encoders was introduced in Python 3.10. - The test imports the specific tutorial's application object (`app`) but doesn't actually use it, so we add a comment to suppress coverage reporting for this line.
