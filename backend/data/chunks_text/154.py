- Defines a function called `select` with four arguments (`entity_0`, `__ent1`, `__ent2`, and `entity_3`) of specific types (_TScalar_0, _TCCA[_T1], _TCCA[_T2], and _TScalar_3 respectively). The `type: ignore` annotation is used to suppress mypy's warning about unused variables `__ent1` and `__ent2`. - Returns a new object of type `Select` which takes a tuple as its argument containing all the input parameters passed to this function. This allows for easy chaining of multiple selection operations in a pipeline fashion.
