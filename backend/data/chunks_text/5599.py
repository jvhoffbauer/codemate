- This method, `schema_name_prefix`, is defined within a class called `SqlalchemyCrud`. - It returns the name of the model being worked with (i.e., the value of `self.model.__name__`) if the current class is `SqlalchemyCrud`. - If the current class is not `SqlalchemyCrud`, it delegates to the parent's implementation of this method using `super()`.
