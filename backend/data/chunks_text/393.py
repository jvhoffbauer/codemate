- Tests if a unique constraint is enforced when trying to duplicate a row in SQLAlchemy using SQLModel and PyTest. - Creates two instances of `Hero`, one with an existing ID (generated by SQLAlchemy), and another with the same values for `secret_name`. - Uses `create_engine` from SQLAlchemy's core module to connect to a new database. - Calls `create_all` on SQLModel's metadata object to generate tables based on defined models. - Adds the first instance to a session and commits it to the database. - Refreshes the first instance to ensure that its ID has been set correctly. - Tries adding the second instance to a new session and expects an IntegrityError exception due to the unique constraint violation.
