- This function is a PUT request handler for updating an existing item with ID `item_id`.
- It takes two arguments: `item_id`, which is required and passed as a path parameter, and `item`, which is also required and contains the updated data to be saved in the database.
- The `q` argument is optional and can contain any query string parameters that should be included in the response (e.g., pagination or filtering). If provided, it's merged into the final dictionary returned by the function.
