- Defines a function `bitwise_not` that takes an expression as input and returns a new SQLAlchemy unary expression with its bits inverted using the built-in `bitwise_not()` function. - The input expression can be either a column or any other value, thanks to the use of the `Union` type hint from the `typing` module. - Note the usage of the `ignore` import from `typeshed` to suppress a warning about the argument type being different than what's expected by the original `sqlalchemy.bitwise_not()`.
