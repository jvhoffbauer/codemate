- Defines a GET request for the `/items/` endpoint using FastAPI's decorator syntax (`@app.get`)
- Uses Pydantic's `Annotated` function to create a parameter called `q`, which can be either a string or `None`. The `Query` annotation is used to extract this value from the URL query parameters and apply regular expressions to it. If the regex pattern matches, the value of `q` will be passed as an argument to the function; otherwise, it will default to `None`. - Returns different messages based on whether `q` has been provided in the URL query parameters. If `q` is not `None`, its value is concatenated with a greeting message; otherwise, a generic greeting message is returned.
