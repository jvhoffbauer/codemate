- This endpoint uses `Depends(asyncgen_state_try)` to pass an asynchronous generator function with a try block that raises an exception (OtherDependencyError). - The `assert` statement checks if the value returned by the dependency is equal to 'asyncgen raise started'. - If both conditions are met, the `RaiseOtherDependencyError` function is called, which raises another type of error (OtherDependencyError), indicating that this endpoint should not be reached due to an issue in its dependencies.
