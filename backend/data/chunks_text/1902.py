- This function is a GET endpoint with the path `/items/{item_id}` where `{item_id}` is replaced by an actual ID value in requests to this endpoint. - The function takes two arguments: `item_id`, which is passed as part of the URL, and `request`, which represents the HTTP request being made. - Inside the function, we extract the hostname (IP address) of the client making the request using the `Request.client` attribute, and store it in a variable called `client_host`. - We then create a dictionary containing both the extracted `client_host` and the `item_id` from the URL, and return that dictionary as the response body for the request.
