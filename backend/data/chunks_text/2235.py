- This function `is_uploadfile_sequence_Annotation()` checks if an annotation represents a sequence (list) of either strings or `UploadFile` objects. - The provided example shows how to use this function with a union type containing both list types. However, the comment suggests that supporting such complex types may have limitations and should be further evaluated before implementing.
