- Defines a function called `select` with four arguments (`__ent0`, `entity_1`, `entity_2`, and `__ent3`) that are annotated using type hints. The first argument is ignored for some reason. - Returns a new object of type `Select` which takes a tuple as its input containing elements of types `_T0`, `_TScalar_1`, `_TScalar_2`, and `_T3`. This suggests that this function performs selection based on multiple criteria from two entities (represented by `entity_1` and `entity_2`) and one or more other entities represented by `__ent0` and `__ent3`. However, without further context it's difficult to provide specific details about what exactly this function does.
