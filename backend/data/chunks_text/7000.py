- Defines a function `get_db` that returns a generator with two values (session and none) using type annotations. - Inside the function, creates a new session object called 'db' from the `SessionLocal` class. - Yields the 'db' to be used in other functions or blocks of code within this function. - Closes the database connection ('db') after it is no longer needed using a `finally` block.
