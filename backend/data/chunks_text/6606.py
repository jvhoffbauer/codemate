- This function tests the behavior of a JSON request with an invalid method (i.e., missing).
- It creates a JSON request object with a missing'method' field and sends it to the server using `json_request()`.
- The expected response is an error message containing details about the missing'method' field.
- Additionally, this function asserts that no messages were sent to the echo service during the execution of the test case.
