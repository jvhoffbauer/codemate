- Initializes a new instance of the class and sets an attribute `_vars` to an empty dictionary using `object.__setattr__()`. This is done instead of directly assigning the variable to avoid calling the setter method (if defined). - The underscore prefix in `_vars` indicates that this attribute should be considered private and not accessed from outside the class.
