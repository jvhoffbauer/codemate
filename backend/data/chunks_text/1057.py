- Defines a function `is_gen_callable` that takes a callable object as an argument (`Callable[..., Any]`) and returns a boolean value indicating whether it's a generator or not. - Uses Python's built-in `inspect` module to check for two cases:
   - If the given callable is itself a generator function (i.e., has the `inspect.GeneratorFunction` class), then it's a generator and we immediately return `True`. - Otherwise, we look for a special method called `__call__`, which is used by some classes to provide customized behavior when calling them like functions. If this attribute exists, we assume that it might be a wrapper around a generator function, so we recursively apply our check on its value using `getattr()`. This allows us to handle nested generators and other more complex scenarios where the outermost function may not be directly a generator but still generates values lazily.
