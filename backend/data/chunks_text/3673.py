- Tests if putting a resource with an invalid token results in a forbidden (403) status code and an error message indicating that the user is not authorized to perform this action on the specified resource. - The `test_put_forbidden` function takes a `TestClient` object as its parameter and uses it to make a PUT request to the `/items/bar` endpoint while passing an invalid token ('jessica') and a valid one ('fake-super-secret-token') in the header's X-Token field. - Asserts that the server returns a HTTP 403 Forbidden status code and displays an appropriate error message containing details about why the operation was denied.
