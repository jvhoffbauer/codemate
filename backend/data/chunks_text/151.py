- This is an overloaded function called `select`. It takes four arguments of types `_TScalar_0`, `_TCCA[_T1]`, `_TCCA[_T2]`, and `_TCCA[_T3]`. The first argument (`entity_0`) has a special type annotation that's ignored by mypy. - If all these arguments are provided, this version of the function returns a new object of type `Select[Tuple[_TScalar_0, _T1, _T2, _T3]]`. - The ellipsis (`...`) indicates that there's more implementation inside the function body, but we don't need to know it for now.
