- Sends a password reset email to a specified email address using Django's built-in `send_email` function from the `django_celery_beat` library.
- The email content is generated by rendering an HTML template and passing in dynamic variables such as the user's email, username, and a unique reset token that expires after a certain number of hours (defined in `settings.py`).
- The email subject includes the project name and the user's email address.
