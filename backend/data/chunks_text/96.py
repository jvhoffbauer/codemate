- Defines a function `funcfilter()` that takes in a SQLAlchemy function element (e.g., `sqlalchemy.func.lower()`) and optional criteria for filtering (either column expressions or boolean values). - Returns an instance of SQLAlchemy's `FunctionFilter` class with the provided function and criteria. - The `*` syntax is used to allow passing multiple criteria as arguments. Note that we need to suppress a mypy warning about argument types using `# type: ignore[arg-type]`. This is because SQLAlchemy's `funcfilter()` accepts both column expressions and booleans as criteria, which mypy cannot infer statically.
