- Defines a GET request for the `/items/` endpoint using FastAPI's decorator syntax (`@app.get`)
- Accepts an argument named `commons`, which is annotated with both `Annotated` and `Depends`. This allows us to pass in a dictionary of common parameters that will be available throughout our application as a dependency injection mechanism.
- Returns the value passed into `commons` via the function signature, making it easily accessible within this route handler.
