- Defines a method `route_delete()` that returns a callable function (a coroutine).
- The inner function `route()` is an asynchronous view function that handles HTTP DELETE requests for deleting one or more items identified by their IDs.
- It checks whether the user has permission to delete using `await self.has_delete_permission(request, item_id)`. If not, it returns an error response.
- Otherwise, it calls `await self.delete_items(request, item_id)` to actually perform the deletion and returns a JSON response with the number of deleted items.
