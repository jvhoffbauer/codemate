- This function tests the `tutorial001` module in the SQLAlchemy tutorial section using pytest's `clear_sqlmodel` fixture to clear any existing database connections. - It imports and sets up the necessary variables for running the `tutorial001` module, including creating a new engine instance. - It creates a mock print function (using `get_testing_print_function`) that captures all printed output during execution of the module. - Finally, it runs the module while passing the mock print function as an argument to `patch`, which replaces the built-in `print` function temporarily. The captured outputs are stored in the `expected_calls` list, which is then compared against the actual call history after executing the module.
