- Defines an overloaded function called `select` with four arguments (`__ent0`, `entity_1`, `__ent2`, and `__ent3`) of types `_TCCA[_T0]`, `_TScalar_1`, `_TCCA[_T2]`, and `_TCCA[_T3]`, respectively. The first argument is ignored due to a type hint (`type: ignore`). - Returns a new object of type `Select[Tuple[_T0, _TScalar_1, _T2, _T3]]`. This indicates that the function returns a tuple containing elements of types `_T0`, `_TScalar_1`, `_T2`, and `_T3`, which are selected based on some condition specified by the user.
