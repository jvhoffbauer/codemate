- Defines a function `get_account()` with two parameters, an optional `account_id` and a required `User` object obtained from `Depends(get_auth_user)`.
- Uses a try-except block to retrieve the specified `Account` using `get_account_by_id()`, raising `AccountNotFound` exception in case it's not found.
- Checks whether the retrieved `Account` is owned by the provided `User` using `owned_by()` method, also raises `AccountNotFound` exception if it's not.
- Returns the `Account` object after successful validation.
