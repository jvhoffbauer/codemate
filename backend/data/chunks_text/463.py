- This is a unit test for the `docs_src.tutorial.where` module's first example (`tutorial001_py310`) using SQLAlchemy and SQLite. - It sets up the necessary variables and functions to run the module's main function in testing mode. - The `get_testing_print_function` function is used to capture all print statements made during execution of the module's main function into a list called 'calls'. - Finally, it checks that the expected output (a single dictionary representing a superhero named Deadpool) was printed by comparing the captured prints against an expected result.
