- Sends a GET request to "/a" using Flask's built-in `client` object and stores the response in `response`.
- Asserts that the status code of the response is 204 (No Content) and displays an error message with the text content if it isn't.
- Checks whether the header 'Content-Length' exists in the response headers and asserts its absence.
- Verifies that the response body is empty by comparing it against an empty byte string ('').
