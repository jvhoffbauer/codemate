- This function takes a `Dependant` object as input and returns a flattened version of it with all its dependencies included. - It allows specifying whether to skip repeating dependencies using the optional `skip_repeats` parameter (default is false). - The function keeps track of already processed dependencies by storing their cache keys in a list called `visited`. - If `skip_repeats` is true, the function skips processing any dependency that has been previously encountered during this recursive call stack. - For each dependency found, the function creates a new `Dependant` object with updated parameters such as `path`, `query`, `headers`, etc., which are extended from those of the current dependency being processed. - Finally, the function returns the flattened `Dependant` object containing all the original dependency's details plus those of its children.
