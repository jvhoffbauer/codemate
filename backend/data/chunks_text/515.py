- This is a unit test for `docs_src/tutorial/connect/select/tutorial001.py`.
- It uses pytest's `@pytest.fixture` to clear SQLModel's metadata and sessionmaker before each test, preventing conflicts between tests.
- The test imports `tutorial001`, sets its URL and engine, creates a mock print function using `get_testing_print_function`, patches builtin `print` with it, runs `main()`, and checks that the expected console output was printed by comparing against `expected_calls`.
