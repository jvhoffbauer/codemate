- Defines a function `build_resp_model` that takes a class as an argument and returns a Pydantic model for representing JSON RPC errors in response messages. - Creates a dictionary of field definitions with names and types for the required error codes ("code"), error messages ("message"), and optional data ("data"). - Retrieves the data model associated with the given class using its `get_data_model` method. If no such model exists, skips this step. - Sets default values for the "data" field based on whether it's required by the class. - Generates a new Pydantic model named after the original class, which includes the common JSON RPC headers ("jsonrpc" and "id") and references the newly created error model instead of directly defining the error fields. - Adds metadata to the generated model using the `ConfigDict` decorator from pydantic-settings. This ensures that any additional settings defined at the module level are applied to all instances of this model.
