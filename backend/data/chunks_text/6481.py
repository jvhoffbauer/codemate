- This method returns an instance of a scheduler object, either from cache (if it already exists) or by creating a new one using a factory function and optional arguments passed in `self.scheduler_kwargs`. - The purpose of this method is to provide a convenient way to access the scheduler without having to create it every time it's needed, while also allowing for customization through the use of a factory function and keyword arguments.
