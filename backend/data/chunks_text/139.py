- Defines a function called `select` with four arguments (`__ent0`, `__ent1`, `entity_2`, and `__ent3`) of types `_TCCA[_T0]`, `_TCCA[_T1]`, `_TScalar_2`, and `_TCCA[_T3]`, respectively. The first two arguments are annotated with underscores to indicate they're not used in this overload. - Returns a new object of type `Select[Tuple[_T0, _T1, _TScalar_2, _T3]]`. This is a generic class that represents a selection operation on multiple input sequences based on a condition specified by the scalar value `entity_2`. - The implementation details for this specific overload are omitted here but can be found within the function body marked as "...".
