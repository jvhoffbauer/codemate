- This function is an asynchronous method that updates items in a database using their IDs and new values provided through a dictionary. - It takes three arguments: `request`, which is not used here; `item_id`, a list of strings representing the IDs of the items to be updated; and `values`, a dictionary containing the new values for each field being updated. - The function returns a list of TableModelT objects (which represent the updated rows), after executing the actual update operation inside the private _update_items() method.
