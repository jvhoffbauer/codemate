- This function tests creating a new user with an email address and setting their superuser flag using the API endpoints.
- The `random_email()` and `random_lower_string()` functions are used to generate unique values for the email and password fields respectively.
- The `crud.user.get_by_email()` method from the `app.core.cruds` module is called to retrieve the newly created user by email.
- Assertions are made to verify that the user was successfully created, has the correct email and superuser flags, and is not yet active (as this will be set later).
