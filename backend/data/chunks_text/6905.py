- Defines a function `validate_request()` that takes an optional argument `header` of type `Optional[str]`. If present, it's passed through FastAPI's security middleware (`Security`) to verify its authenticity using Google Cloud Secret Manager. - Raises a customized HTTP exception with status code 400 and error message "NO_API_KEY" in case no API key is provided as request header. - Raises another customized HTTP exception with status code 401 and error message "AUTH_REQ" in case the provided API key doesn't match the one stored in config file or secret manager. - Returns `True` otherwise, indicating successful validation.
