- This method is called when an item is deleted from the dictionary using the `del` keyword or by calling the `pop()` method with a key argument that doesn't exist in the dictionary. - It deletes the specified key (`name`) from the underlying Redis hash table represented by the `_redis_client` attribute of the class instance. - The implementation uses Python's built-in `del` statement to remove the key from Redis and avoids any unnecessary copying or conversion between Python dictionaries and Redis hashes.
