- This endpoint is accessed using GET request and requires authentication (JWT token). - The `get_token_data()` function is used to extract user information from the JWT token passed in the authorization header. - If authentication fails, a `HTTPException` with status code 401 Unauthorized will be raised by FastAPI's dependency injection system. - Otherwise, the string "Hello World!" is returned as response body.
