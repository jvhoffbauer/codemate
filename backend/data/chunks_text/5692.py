- Decorator function `labels()` returns a list of strings, which are the labels associated with each value in the choices tuple defined by the decorated class. - The values and corresponding labels are extracted from the `choices` attribute using list comprehension. - This decorator can be used to easily access the labels without having to iterate over the choices or define separate lists for labels and values.
