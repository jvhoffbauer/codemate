- Modifies the schema of a specific field during model initialization by updating its data type and format to string with binary encoding using the `__modify_schema__()` method provided by Marshmallow.
- Allows for customization of the schema based on specific requirements or constraints without modifying the original definition of the model's fields.
- Enables better compatibility between the model and external systems that expect binary data in string format instead of byte arrays.
