- This function is a GET request for retrieving all items from the database using FastAPI's `@app.get()` decorator. - The `response_model` parameter specifies that the API should return an array of objects conforming to the `schemas.Item` schema defined elsewhere in the application. - Two query parameters are accepted by this endpoint: `skip` and `limit`. These values determine how many items to omit (i.e., "skip") at the beginning of the result set, as well as how many results to include ("limit"). Both defaults are provided via the `Depends()` function, which allows us to pass arguments into our functions without having to explicitly accept them as arguments. In this case, we use it to retrieve a session object from the `get_db()` function, which handles connecting to the database and returning a SQLAlchemy session object. We then call the `crud.get_items()` method with these arguments to perform the actual database operation.
