- This method is called when an attribute of the object is accessed that doesn't exist in its class or instance dictionary (i.e., it's a "missing" attribute). - It delegates the missing attribute lookup to `_redis_client`, which is assumed to be an instance variable containing our Redis client connection. - By returning the result of calling `getattr()` on this client with the same name as the missing attribute, we effectively forward any requests for non-existent attributes directly onto Redis itself.
