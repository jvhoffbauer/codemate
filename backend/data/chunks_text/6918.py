- This function is used to gracefully shut down and release resources of a Redis connection pool created using `redis.from_url`. - It calls the `close()` method on each open connection in the pool, which sends a `QUIT` command to the server and waits for it to respond before closing the connection. - After all connections have been closed, this function returns without doing anything else.
