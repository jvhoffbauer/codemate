- This function is a callback method that gets called after executing a list operation (e.g., GET /items). - It takes four arguments: `request`, `result`, `data`, and `**kwargs`. - The `Request` object represents the incoming HTTP request. - The `Result` object contains the results of the SQLAlchemy query. - The `ItemListSchema` class defines the structure of the response body. - Inside this function, we parse the raw query results using our custom parser (`self.parser`) to convert each row into a dictionary format. - We then append these dictionaries to the `items` attribute of the `ItemListSchema` instance passed as an argument. - Finally, we transform each dictionary back into a list item object by calling our helper method `list_item()`.
