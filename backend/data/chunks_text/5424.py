- Defines an `info` method for registering the `/info` and `/info.geojson` endpoints using FastAPI's dependency injection system to pass arguments like environment variables, path dependencies, and parameter defaults between functions. - Uses Pydantic's model schema (`response_model`) to define the expected output format of each endpoint. - Utilizes OpenAPI specification (OAS) to document the endpoints' behavior through the `responses` dictionary in OAS syntax. - Returns information about the MosaicJSON dataset by wrapping the underlying RasterIO library calls inside a context manager that handles environment variable passing and other parameters passed via function arguments. - Provides an alternative GeoJSON representation of the same data by returning it as a single GeoJSON feature instead of a JSON object.
