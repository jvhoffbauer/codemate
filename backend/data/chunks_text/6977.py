- This function generates headers for making requests as a superuser by first logging in with the provided credentials and returning an authorization header containing the access token obtained from the login response. - The `settings.FIRST_USER_EMAIL` and `settings.FIRST_USER_PASSWORD` variables are assumed to be defined elsewhere in the application's configuration or environment variables. - The `AsyncClient` class is likely being used to make HTTP requests using asyncio, which allows for concurrent I/O operations without blocking the event loop.
