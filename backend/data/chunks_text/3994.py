- Generates an OpenAPI schema for a FastAPI application using the `openapi()` decorator and saves it to a JSON file at `/openapi.json`.
- The generated schema includes information about endpoints (e.g., GET /items/, POST /items/) as well as request and response formats.
- In this example, the POST endpoint for creating items is described with details such as required parameters ("name" and "tags"), allowed content types (including YAML), and expected responses (success status code 200).
