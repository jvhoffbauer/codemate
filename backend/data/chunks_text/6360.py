- Defines a function `process_tag` that takes an optional environment dictionary as argument (default is empty). - Creates a new environment dictionary by merging the current OS environment and the passed in environment dictionary using the `dict.update()` method with unpacking syntax (`**`) to avoid creating a temporary variable for storing the merged dictionary. - Assigns the value of either'scripts/test.sh' or'scripts/build-push.sh', depending on whether the `build_push` flag is set. - Executes the shell script using the `subprocess.call()` function with the specified arguments and environment dictionary. - Exits the Python program with the exit status returned by the shell script, unless it was successful (i.e., return code equals zero), in which case execution continues normally.
