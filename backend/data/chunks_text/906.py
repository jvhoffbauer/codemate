- This function serializes a response object using Pydantic's ModelFields and JSON encoder.
- It takes several optional arguments to customize the serialization process, such as which fields to include or exclude, whether to exclude unset values, etc.
- If a specific ModelField is provided for serializing a nested object, it will be used instead of the default JSON encoding. Otherwise, the entire response object will be encoded with `jsonable_encoder`.
- The function raises an exception (ResponseValidationError) if any validation errors occur during deserialization of the response content.
