- Defines a test fixture named `async_api_client` using Pytest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The function returns an instance of Flask's built-in `AsyncTestClient`, which is used to make asynchronous HTTP requests against an ASGI application (such as our FastAPI app). - This allows us to easily and consistently create a client for testing our API endpoints in an asynchronous context, without having to manually set up and configure it each time we write a test.
