- Defines an overloaded function called `select` with two positional arguments of types `_TScalar_0` and `_TScalar_1`. The `type: ignore` annotation is used to suppress a mypy warning about unused variables in this context. - Returns an instance of the generic class `Select`, which takes a tuple as its argument containing both input entities (of types `_TScalar_0` and `_TScalar_1`) as separate elements. This allows for more complex selections involving multiple entities.
