- Defines an `async` function called `session` that takes a parameter named `test_db_setup_sessionmaker`. This is likely used to create database sessions during tests. - Uses the `asyncwith` statement to open and automatically close an `AsyncSession`, which allows multiple asynchronous operations on the same connection. - Yields the opened `AsyncSession` so it can be used by other functions or statements within this function. - Deletes all rows from every table defined in SQLAlchemy's metadata using the `delete()` method of the `SQLAlchemy` ORM. - Commits any pending changes made during the session before exiting the context manager.
