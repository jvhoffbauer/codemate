- This method `filter()` is called when logging messages using Celery's logger adapter. - It appends two UUID-like strings (`celery_parent_id` and `celery_current_id`) to the log record. These identifiers are used in Celery to track task execution context. - The values for these identifiers are retrieved from global variables `celery_parent_id` and `celery_current_id`, which are set elsewhere in Celery's configuration. - The string lengths of these identifiers are trimmed to match a specified length (stored in `self.uuid_length`) before being added to the log record.
