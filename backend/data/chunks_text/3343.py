- This function is a unit test for checking if a hidden query parameter can be accessed and returned correctly in Flask application's API endpoint. - It takes three arguments: `path`, which is the URL path of the API endpoint to be tested; `expected_status`, which is an integer representing the HTTP status code that should be returned by the server when accessing this endpoint with the hidden query parameter; and `expected_response`, which is a JSON object containing the data that should be returned as the response body. - The function creates a new instance of `TestClient` from the Flask app being tested, sends a GET request to the specified path using the created client, checks whether the received HTTP status code matches the expected one, and finally compares the actual response body (returned as a dictionary) against the expected one.
