- This endpoint uses a synchronous generator function as its dependency using FastAPI's `Depends()` decorator for method level dependencies. - The `value` parameter is passed to the view function, which returns it after retrieving it from the dependency. - Using synchronous generators in this way can improve performance and reduce resource usage compared to traditional list comprehensions or loops with yield statements.
