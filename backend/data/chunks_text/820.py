- This endpoint handles refreshing access tokens using a `PUT` request to `/users/tokens`. - The `BackgroundTasks` decorator is used to schedule tasks for asynchronous execution in the background. - Two dependencies are passed into the function: `valid_refresh_token` and `valid_refresh_token_user`, which validate the incoming `refresh_token` and retrieve the associated user information respectively. - A new refresh token is created by calling `service.create_refresh_token()` with the user ID from the old refresh token. - The new refresh token's settings (e.g., expiration time) are added to the HTTP response cookies via `utils.get_refresh_token_settings()`. - The old refresh token is scheduled for deletion using `worker.add_task(service.expire_refresh_token, refresh_token["uuid"])`. - Finally, an updated access token is returned along with the newly generated refresh token.
