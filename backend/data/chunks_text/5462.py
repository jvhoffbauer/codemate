- This fixture is automatically called by PyTest (`autouse=True`) and returns a `TestClient` object for testing purposes. - The `set_env` parameter is passed to this fixture, which likely sets up some environment variables or configurations needed for the test suite. - The `app` variable is imported from the `titiler.application.main` module, which presumably contains the Flask application being tested.
