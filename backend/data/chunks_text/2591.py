- This function defines an asynchronous method called `get_value_by_ws`. It takes a `websocket` object and an optional argument `value`, which is obtained using the `extract_value_from_http_connection` dependency. - The function first waits for the connection to be accepted by sending back an acknowledgement message (`await websocket.accept()`) before returning the requested value in JSON format (`await websocket.send_json(value)`). - Finally, it closes the web socket connection (`await websocket.close()`).
