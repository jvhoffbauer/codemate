- This method is called by FastAPI to check if a user has permission to update an object using PUT or PATCH requests. - It takes four arguments: `request`, which represents the HTTP request; `item_id`, which contains the ID of the object being updated (if provided); `obj`, which holds the data that will be used to update the object; and optional keyword arguments passed from the decorator. - The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the user should be allowed to perform the update operation. In this case, it always allows updates since we're returning `True`.
