- Defines a function `get_valid_exclude_unset()` that returns an instance of `Item` with a specific name and price. - The returned object has an aliased name "valid" instead of using its actual class name, which can improve readability in certain contexts. - This function is useful for situations where we want to exclude unset or null values from being passed as arguments by providing a default value that meets our requirements.
