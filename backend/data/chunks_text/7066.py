- Defines a fixture named `superuser_token_headers`, scoped to the module level (i.e., available for all tests in this file). - Uses the `get_superuser_auth_header()` function from another part of the application to retrieve an authentication header containing a token for the superuser user. - Returns the resulting dictionary as the value of the fixture.
