- This function is a wrapper around `crud.get_users()`, which retrieves a list of slow users from a database or API.
- It takes two optional arguments, `skip` and `limit`, to control pagination behavior.
- The function also includes an internal variable called `sleep_time`, which can be configured by calling this function with keyword arguments (default values are provided). This variable determines how long the function will wait before returning the result, simulating a slow processing request. By decrementing it in each call, we gradually decrease the delay over time, making the simulation more realistic.
