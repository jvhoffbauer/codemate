- This method is called to check if a user has permission to select data from a specific dataset (represented by `name`) in Django Rest Framework's viewsets. - It returns a boolean value indicating whether the user has access or not. - In this case, we are assuming that all users have permissions for selecting datasets and returning true always. However, you can replace it with your custom logic based on user roles, authentication tokens, etc., as per your application requirements.
