- Sets up an instance of `AdminSite` with a custom admin class called `TmpAdmin2`.
- Retrieves the registered admin object from the site and saves it in a variable for later use.
- Registers the router created by the `AdminSite` to make its URLs accessible.
- Makes a POST request to the page path of the newly registered admin object to retrieve the initial JSON response containing the form configuration.
- Asserts that the type of the body is 'form', the initialization API URL matches the expected value, and both required fields ('username' and 'password') are present in the HTML content returned by the server.
- Makes a GET request to the form API endpoint to verify that the correct data is being passed back when submitting the form via AJAX.
