- Imports a function `client` from another module and tests its GET request to retrieve data about users with specific parameters (`q`, `skip`, and `limit`) using Pytest's built-in `assert` statement for testing responses. - The expected status code is set as 200, and if it fails, the text of the response is printed out for debugging purposes. - The JSON response body is also checked against an expected dictionary containing the message string and default parameter values.
