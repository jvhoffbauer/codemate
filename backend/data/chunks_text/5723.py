- This method is an asynchronous function that checks if a user has permission to access a specific page based on the "action" parameter passed in (in this case, "page"). - It returns `True` if the user has the required permission and `False` otherwise. - If the user doesn't have permission, it calls another method called `error_no_page_permission()`, which likely raises an error or displays some kind of message indicating that the user doesn't have permission to view the requested page.
