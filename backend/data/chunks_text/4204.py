- This function is a unit test for the `GET /` endpoint of an API or web application. - It uses Flask's built-in testing client to simulate sending a GET request to the root URL (`/`) and stores the response in the `response` variable. - The first assert statement checks that the status code of the response is 200 OK, which indicates success. If it fails, the second argument of `assert` is printed as an error message. - The second assert statement compares the text content of the response with a hardcoded string ("Hello World"). Again, if they don't match, an error message will be displayed.
