- Defines a function `get_python_type_parse` that takes an argument `field`, which can be either an InstrumentedAttribute, Column or Label object from SQLAlchemy. - Uses the @lru_cache decorator to cache the result of this function for performance optimization. - Tries to extract the Python type of the expression associated with the given field using SQLAlchemy's TypeEngine class. - If the extracted Python type is a subclass of datetime.date and also a subclass of datetime.datetime (i.e., it represents both date and time), returns the `parse_datetime` function. Otherwise, returns the `parse_date` function. - If the extraction fails due to lack of implementation in SQLAlchemy, falls back to returning the built-in `str` function as a default parser.
