- This test checks if a POST request to the login endpoint with just the password field filled in returns a 422 status code and an error message containing 'Field required' for the missing username field. - The `IsDict` type hint is used to ensure that the JSON response returned by the server is a dictionary. - Two possible formats of the error message are tested using the `|` operator (OR) in the type hint. One format corresponds to Pydantic version 1.x, while the other is for newer versions.
