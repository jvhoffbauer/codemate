- This function listens to the `after_insert` event of SQLAlchemy's User model using the `@event.listens_for()` decorator. - The function takes three arguments: mapper (the mapping object), connection (the database connection), and target (the newly inserted user). - Inside the function, we check if the type of `target` is our User model using an assert statement. - Finally, we increment a global counter called `event_counter.after`.
