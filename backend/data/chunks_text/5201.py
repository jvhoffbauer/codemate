- Defines an `info()` function that registers two endpoints for retrieving metadata about a raster file: `/info` and `/info.geojson`. Both functions take several dependencies (e.g., path to the file, parameters for reading it). The returned data is handled differently based on the requested format (JSON or GeoJSON). - Uses FastAPI's dependency injection system to pass arguments between functions without having to repeat them multiple times. This improves readability and reduces duplication in the codebase. - Utilizes Pydantic models to define the expected input and output formats for each endpoint. These models are used by FastAPI to validate user requests and generate informative error messages if necessary. - Includes detailed documentation using docstrings to explain what each function does and how it should be called. This makes it easier for other developers to understand and use your API.
