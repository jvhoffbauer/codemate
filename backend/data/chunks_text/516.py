- This function tests the `tutorial002` module in the `docs_src.tutorial.connect.select` package using pytest's `clear_sqlmodel` fixture to clear any existing SQLAlchemy metadata and objects before running each test case. - The `import` statement imports the `tutorial002` module, which contains a SQLAlchemy session factory that connects to an SQLite database at the specified URL (stored in the `sqlite_url` variable). - The `create_engine` function is called to create a connection pool for the engine object, which is then assigned to the `engine` attribute of the `mod` object. - A list named `calls` is initialized to store the output of the `print` statements made during execution of the `main` function. - The `get_testing_print_function` function is used to replace the built-in `print` function with a custom implementation that captures its arguments and stores them in the `calls` list instead of printing them directly to the console. - The `patch` decorator is applied to the `builtins.print` built-in function to replace it with our custom print function during the execution of this test case. - Finally, we call the `main` function of the `mod` object within the context manager provided by the `with` statement, passing the captured `print` function as an argument to the `patch` decorator. After executing the `main` function, we check whether the contents of the `calls` list match what was expected based on the behavior described in the documentation for the `tutorial002` module.
