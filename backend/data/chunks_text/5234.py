- Defines a dataclass called `BidxExprParams`, which is a subclass of both `ExpressionParams` and `BidxParams`.
- This allows for combining band index (bidx) and expression parameter settings in a single object.
- The class definition itself doesn't contain any functionality or behavior; it simply provides a convenient way to group related properties together.
