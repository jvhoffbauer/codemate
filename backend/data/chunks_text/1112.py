- This function handles a POST request to the `/token` endpoint and returns an Access Token in response. - The `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm` dependency is used to extract the username and password from the request body. - If the provided credentials are valid (i.e., the user exists), an Access Token with an expiration time of ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES minutes is created using the `create_access_token` function. - The token's payload includes the sub (subject) field containing the user's username and scopes field containing any requested scopes. - The resulting dictionary contains both the generated Access Token and its associated type ("Bearer").
