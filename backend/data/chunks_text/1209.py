- This endpoint retrieves the name and description of an item with a specific ID using FastAPI's `@app.get()` decorator. - The path parameter is named `item_id`, which is passed as a string to the function. - The returned value from this function is an instance of the Item model (defined elsewhere), with only its 'name' and 'description' fields included in the response body (specified by the `response_model_include` argument).
