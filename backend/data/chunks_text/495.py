- This function tests a specific tutorial (tutorial001_py310 in the offset_and_limit module of the tutorial directory) using pytest fixtures `clear_sqlmodel`, `get_testing_print_function`, and `patch`. - The SQLAlchemy engine is created with an in-memory SQLite database, and the `expected_calls` list is not shown here but presumably contains expected print statements generated by running the tutorial's main function. - The built-in Python `print()` function is replaced with a custom one that captures its output for testing purposes.
