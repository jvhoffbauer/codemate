- This function updates a user's information in both the database and Couchbase sync gateway using the `Bucket` object provided as an argument.
- The `username`, `UserUpdate`, and optional `persist_to` arguments are passed to the `update_in_db` helper function to perform the actual database update.
- After updating the database, the updated user data is synced with the sync gateway by creating a new `UserSyncIn` object from the updated dictionary and calling `update_sync_gateway`.
- If the password was included in the `UserUpdate` object, it is also added to the synchronized data for consistency.
