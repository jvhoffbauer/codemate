- Defines a Pydantic model named `JsonRpcRequest`, which is used to represent JSON RPC requests with specific fields and constraints. - The component name "_Request" is added as an attribute using the `@component_name()` decorator from FastAPI's OpenAPI generator plugin. This allows for better organization of models within the API documentation. - The `jsonrpc` field is set to a literal value of "2.0" and includes an example in the schema definition. - The `id` field can be either a string or integer, but defaults to None if not specified. It also has an example provided in the schema definition. - The `method` field must be a strict string representing the requested operation. - The `params` field is a dictionary that represents any additional parameters required by the requested operation. It has a default factory function that returns an empty dictionary if no value is provided. - The `model_config` attribute uses the `ConfigDict` class from Pydantic's configuration module to define custom validation rules for this model. In this case, it sets the `extra` property to "forbid", meaning that extra keys are not allowed in the input data beyond what is defined in the schema.
