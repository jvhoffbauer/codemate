- Defines a GET request for the `/items/` endpoint using FastAPI's decorator syntax
- Includes a query parameter named `hidden_query`, which is optional and can be set to any string value (default is none)
- The `include_in_schema` argument is used to exclude this query parameter from being included in the API schema documentation generated by FastAPI
- If the `hidden_query` parameter is present in the URL query string, it returns an object containing just that key-value pair; otherwise, it returns a different message indicating that the query was not found
