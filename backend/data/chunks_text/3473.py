- Defines a new endpoint `/products` with an HTTP POST method using FastAPI's decorator syntax. - Accepts JSON data in the format of a `Product` object defined elsewhere (not shown here) and validates it using Pydantic's `Body()` function. - Sets the media type to be parsed as JSON and enables embedding of nested objects within the request body. - Does not execute any functionality at this time due to the use of the `pragma: no cover` comment, which is used for test coverage purposes.
