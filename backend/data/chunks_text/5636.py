- Creates a subclass of `Model` using `create_model_by_model()`, which is a function provided by Django Rest Framework (DRF). - The name of the new model will be formed by appending "_Filter" to the prefix specified in `self.schema_name_prefix`. - The `set_none=True` argument passed to `create_model_by_model()` ensures that nullable fields are created as None types instead of defaulting to zero or empty strings.
