- This function sets up a Couchbase username and password for authentication purposes using the `requests` library to interact with the Couchbase web console settings endpoint. - It takes four arguments: `cluster_url`, which is the URL of the Couchbase server; `username`, which is the new username to be set; and `password`, which is the corresponding password. The fourth argument, `*`, allows for keyword arguments that are not specified in the function signature but can still be passed when calling it (e.g., `setup_couchbase_username_password(..., some_other_arg="some value")`). - If the request to update the username and password is successful (i.e., returns an HTTP status code of 200), the function returns True; otherwise, False.
