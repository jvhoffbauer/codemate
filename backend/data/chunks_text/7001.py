- This function retrieves the currently logged-in user from a database using FastAPI's dependency injection and OAuth2 authentication provided by PyJWT library. - It first tries to decode the JWT token passed as an argument using PyJWT's `jwt.decode()`. If the token is expired or cannot be validated for any reason, it raises an appropriate HTTP exception with an error message. - The decoded token data is then used to retrieve the corresponding user record from the database using CRUD operations defined elsewhere in the application. - If the user record is not found, another HTTP exception is raised with a different error message. - Finally, the authenticated user object is returned to the caller of this function.
