- This fixture is automatically called by PyTest (set `autouse=True`) and overrides the dependency `get_session()` with a new value, which in this case is the current `AsyncSession`. - The `app.dependency_overrides` dictionary allows us to replace dependencies at runtime for testing purposes. - By replacing the `get_session()` function with our own implementation that returns the test database connection, we can ensure that all other functions using `get_session()` will use the same connection during tests.
