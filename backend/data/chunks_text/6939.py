- This function defines a POST endpoint for creating tasks using FastAPI's router decorator. - The `response_model` parameter specifies that the API should return a JSON object with a single field called "id" of type int (representing the task ID). - The `status_code` parameter sets the HTTP status code to be returned by this endpoint when it is successful. - Inside the function body, we use Redis' enqueue_job method to add a new task to our queue with the given message and store its ID in the `job` variable. - Finally, we return an object containing just the `job_id` as specified by the `response_model`.
