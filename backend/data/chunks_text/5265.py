- Applies contours to an input image using OpenCV's `cv2.fillPoly()` function with a custom color map based on terrain elevation values.
- Rescales the minimum and maximum z-values of the input image to a range of 1-255 for better visualization in the output image.
- Sets pixels below a certain threshold value to black to create visible contour lines.
