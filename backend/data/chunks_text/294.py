- Retrieves a list of heroes from the database using SQLAlchemy's `Session` and `select()` functions, filtering by age less than or equal to 35. - Loops through each result (`ResultProxy`) returned by executing the query and prints out its properties using Python's built-in `print()`. - Uses a context manager (`with Session(engine):...`) to ensure that the connection is properly closed after use.
