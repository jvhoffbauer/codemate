- Defines a GET request for the root URL of the application (/)
- Returns an instance of `ColorMapType`, which is likely a custom data model representing a color map, using FastAPI's dependency injection feature to pass in a `ColorMapParams` object from another function called `dependencies.ColorMapParams`. This allows for more complex and reusable logic outside of this endpoint.
