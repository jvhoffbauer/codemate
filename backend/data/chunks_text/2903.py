- This endpoint returns the currently logged in user's information using FastAPI dependency injection and Pydantic models for type hinting and validation. - The `read_current_user()` function takes a parameter named `current_user`, which is automatically injected by FastAPI using the `Depends()` decorator, and passed as an argument to the `get_current_user()` function from the `fastapi.security` module. - By defining the type of the `current_user` parameter as a `User` model (which inherits from Pydantic's BaseModel), we can ensure that the returned object conforms to our expected schema, making it easier to work with and validate downstream.
