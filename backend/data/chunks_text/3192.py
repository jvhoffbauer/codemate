- Tests whether `jsonable_encoder()` correctly encodes a custom model with an alias (in this case, `ModelWithAlias`) by comparing its output to a predefined dictionary representation of the same object. - Uses the `assert` statement to check if both outputs are equal and raises an AssertionError exception if they're not. - The `test_*()` function naming convention follows PEP8 style guidelines for testing functions in Python.
