- This endpoint returns a JSON response with the value of the `nodata` parameter from the `DatasetParams` dependency, which represents missing or undefined data in FastAPI applications using SQLAlchemy ORM. - The `response_class` argument specifies that the response should be serialized as JSON using the `JSONResponse` class provided by FastAPI's built-in serialization module. - The `@app.get()` decorator defines this function as an HTTP GET request handler for the "/nan" URL path.
