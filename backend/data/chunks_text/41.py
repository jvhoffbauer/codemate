- Defines a dataclass `ObjectWithUpdateWrapper` that takes an object (`obj`) and an update dictionary (`update`) as arguments. - Overrides the `__getattribute__()` method to dynamically retrieve attributes from either the wrapped object or the update dictionary based on whether the attribute is present in the latter. This allows for updating specific properties of an existing object without modifying its original state.
