- This method gets an existing admin object of a specific type (specified by `admin_cls`) from a dictionary called `_registered`. If it doesn't exist, this method creates a new one using the specified class (`admin_cls`) as long as registration is enabled and there are no other registrations in progress. - The creation process involves instantiating the admin class with the current context (in this case, the Django app being used), storing it in the `_registered` dictionary, and optionally adding it to another list called `children` for page schema admins. - Whether or not the newly created admin object is returned depends on whether registration is allowed and whether any other registrations are currently underway (stored in `__register_lock`). Otherwise, `None` is returned instead.
