- Tests whether custom middleware affects the context variable context for dependencies by checking if the code before `yield` and after `yield` runs in the same context variable context using `request_state_context_var`. - Raises an error if the code is executed in a different context variable context to ensure consistency in dependency resolution. - Verifies that the expected JSON response and header value are returned when making a GET request to "/user".
