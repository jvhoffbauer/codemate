- Defines a function called `update_item` that takes two arguments: `item_id`, which is required and of type integer, and `item`, which is also required but its type is defined using FastAPI's `Body()` decorator. The body parameter allows us to define how the request body should be parsed into Python objects. In this case, we are defining an `Item` object (which seems to be a custom class) as the expected input for our endpoint. - Inside the function, we create a dictionary called `results` containing both the `item_id` and the updated `item`. This will allow us to easily pass back all the necessary information in one go when returning from the function. - Finally, we simply return the `results` dictionary.
