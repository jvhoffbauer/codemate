- This endpoint is accessed by making a GET request to the root URL (/) of the application. - The `main` function takes an optional argument called `algorithm`, which is obtained using FastAPI's Dependencies feature and passed on to another function named `algorithms.dependency`. - If the `algorithm` parameter is provided, it is used to process the input image (stored in the `ImageData` object), and the maximum pixel value from the resulting output is returned as a list. - Otherwise, the maximum pixel value from the original input image is returned directly as a list.
