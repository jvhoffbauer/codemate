- This function handles PUT requests to update or create an item with a specific ID (item_id). - It takes two optional parameters `name` and `size`, which are passed through FastAPI's body parser using the `Body()` decorator. - If the specified item exists in the dictionary `items`, it updates its corresponding fields 'name' and'size'. Otherwise, it creates a new entry in `items`. - The updated/created item is returned as a response with HTTP status code 201 CREATED for newly created entries.
