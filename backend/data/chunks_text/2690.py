- Defines a function called `response_model_none_annotation_return_exact_dict` that returns an exact dictionary representing a user object with keys 'name' and'surname'. - The function has a type hint specifying that it should return a `User`, but since we are returning an exact dictionary, this is not strictly necessary as Pydantic will still be able to infer the correct type based on the returned values. However, some developers prefer to include these types of annotations for clarity or consistency in their codebase.
