- This method generates a JSON representation of the current page's content based on its schema and children pages.
- It handles different types of schemas such as App, CollapseGroup, Tabs, Schema_, SchemaAPI, Link, and IFrame.
- The `exclude` parameter allows excluding certain attributes from being included in the output to reduce redundancy.
- If the page has no schema but contains child pages, it creates an App object with those pages nested inside.
- For collapsed groups, it converts them into CollapseItems with headers and bodies generated recursively using the same method.
- For regular groups, it converts them into TabItems with titles and bodies generated recursively using the same method.
- If the page has an embedded schema like IFrame, it sets its height to a default value.
- If the page links to another URL, it creates a simple link element instead.
- Finally, it returns the resulting JSON object representing the page's content.
