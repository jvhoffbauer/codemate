- Defines a function `get_current_user()` that takes an optional argument `oauth_header`. If provided, it extracts the OpenID (OAuth) header and uses it to retrieve the current user from the database using the `User` model. - The extracted OAuth header is passed as the username parameter to create a new instance of the `User` class. - The resulting `User` object is returned by the function for further use in the application's logic.
