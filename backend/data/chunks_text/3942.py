- Defines a fixture named `client` using pytest's built-in `fixture()` decorator. - The `get_client()` function is defined as the implementation of this fixture, which returns an instance of FlaskTestClient obtained by creating a test client for the application imported from the specified module and class (`docs_src.query_params_str_validations.tutorial011_an_py310`) within that module. - This fixture can be used in other tests to easily obtain a preconfigured test client for interacting with the application under test without having to repeatedly create one each time it's needed.
