- This function tests a non-regular expression query using the `test_query` method from the previous example, but with a different search term ("nonregexquery") that doesn't follow the regular expression pattern defined in the server (`^fixedquery$`) for filtering items. - The expected behavior is an HTTP status code of 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and an error message indicating that the string input ("nonregexquery") fails to match the specified regular expression pattern ("^fixedquery$"). - The error message includes details such as the location of the invalid field (in this case, the query parameter "q"), the type of validation failure (`string_pattern_mismatch`), and the specifics of the regular expression pattern being checked against.
