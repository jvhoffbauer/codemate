- This function is a decorator for database operations that handles exceptions thrown by SQLAlchemy's `Session.execute()`. - If an `IntegrityError` occurs (e.g., primary key violation), it raises a custom HTTP exception with status code 422 and detailed message "Key already exists". - For other types of exceptions (such as HTTP errors), this function simply re-raises them without modification. - Otherwise, it raises a generic internal server error with a descriptive message including the original exception details.
