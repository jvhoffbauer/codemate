- Retrieves or creates a user in the database based on the provided email address and returns their authentication header using FastAPI's built-in `get_auth_header` function. - The user creation/updating process involves passing the email and password to the CRUD operations (crud.user.get_by_email(), crud.user.create(), crud.user.update()). - The returned dictionary contains the necessary authorization headers required by the API endpoints that require authentication.
