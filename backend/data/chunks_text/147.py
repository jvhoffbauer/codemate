- Defines a function called `select` with four arguments (`__ent0`, `entity_1`, `entity_2`, and `__ent3`) that are annotated using type hints (`_TCCA` and `_TScalar_*`). The first argument is ignored for some reason. - Returns a new object of type `Select` containing tuples consisting of elements from the input sequences/arrays specified by `__ent0`, `entity_1`, `entity_2`, and `__ent3`. This operation is commonly used in database queries to filter or project data based on certain conditions.
