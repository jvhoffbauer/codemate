- Defines a fixture named `client` using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called by PyTest when it needs an instance of the `client`. - Inside the `get_function()`, we first import the Flask application object (`app`) from our tutorial example located in `docs_src/schema_extra_example/tutorial005_py310`. - We then create a new instance of the `TestClient` class provided by Flask's testing module and pass the imported `app` as its constructor argument. - Finally, we return the newly created `client` instance so that it can be used inside test functions decorated with `@pytest.mark.usefixtures("client")`.
