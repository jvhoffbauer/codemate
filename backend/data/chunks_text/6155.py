- Defines a function `lint()` that runs the Python linter (pylint) on the 'app' directory within the current context (`ctx`) using the `subprocess.Popen()` method implicitly called by the `Context().run()` command. - The `lintrc` configuration file for pylint is not specified, so it will use default settings. - This function can be used to automatically run the linter during development or as part of a continuous integration process.
