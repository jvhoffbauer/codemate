- This function tests the use of an access token to authenticate a request for logging in with a specific username (i.e., 'test-token') using the `requests` library and the Flask application's API endpoints. - The `get_server_api()` method is called to retrieve the base URL of the Flask app's API. - A POST request is made to the login endpoint with the superuser access token as the authentication header. - The response JSON is checked for the expected keys ('username'). - The status code is also verified to be 200 OK.
