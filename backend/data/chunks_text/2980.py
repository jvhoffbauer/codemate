- Tests if a ValueError is raised when trying to access the OpenAPI schema without authentication using the `client.get()` method. - Uses PyTest's `with` statement and raises an exception (in this case, `pytest.raises`) to simulate an error scenario for testing purposes. - Imports the Flask-RESTful client object from the application instance (assuming it has been initialized) and uses its `get()` method to request the OpenAPI JSON file at the specified URL.
