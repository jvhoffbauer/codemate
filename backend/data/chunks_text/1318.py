- This function is a PUT request handler for updating an existing item with ID `item_id`.
- It accepts optional query parameters to specify various time-related constraints on when and how often the item should be processed. These include starting datetime (`start_datetime`), ending datetime (`end_datetime`), repeating interval (`repeat_at`), and processing delay after triggering (`process_after`).
- The function calculates the actual start time of the process based on these inputs and returns a dictionary containing all relevant information about the updated item.
