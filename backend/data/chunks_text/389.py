- Defines a `Team` and `Hero` SQLAlchemy model using FastAPI's SQL Model extension (sqlmodel). Both models have an optional ID as primary key, an indexed string field for names, and another string or integer field for additional data. The `Team` also has a list of related `Heroes`, while the `Hero` has an optional reference to its associated `Team`. - Raises a `RuntimeError` when trying to create a `Team` without specifying any arguments for the `Relationship` between `Team` and `Hero`. This is because the `sa_relationship_args` parameter requires at least one argument, which in this case would be the name of the relationship on the other side (i.e., "Hero"). Without it, SQLAlchemy cannot determine how to join the tables together.
