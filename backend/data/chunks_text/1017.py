- This function is an asynchronous view function that takes a `Request` object and returns either an optional string (if authentication succeeds) or raises an exception (if authentication fails). - It extracts the Authorization header from the request and parses it to obtain the authentication scheme ("Bearer" in this case) and parameter (the token itself). - If no Authorization header is present or the wrong scheme is used, it can either raise a HTTPException with appropriate error details and WWW-Authenticate header, or simply return None without raising any errors (this should be avoided for security reasons).
