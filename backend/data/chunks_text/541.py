- This function tests a specific example (tutorial001_py310) in the SQLModel documentation by using pytest fixtures to clear the database and set up the necessary variables for running the script. - The `create_engine()` function is used to connect to an SQLite database, which is then passed to the main function of the tutorial module being tested. - A mocking library called `unittest.mock` is used to intercept the built-in print statement and capture its output in a list called `calls`. After executing the main function, the captured outputs are compared against expected values stored in another variable named `expected_calls`.
