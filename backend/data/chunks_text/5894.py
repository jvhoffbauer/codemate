- This method is called `read_items()`, which reads multiple data based on a list of IDs provided by the user's request. - It inherits from the parent class `super().read_items()`. - The method filters out fields that the user doesn't have permission to access using `await self.get_deny_fields(request, "read")`. - Finally, it returns a new list with each original item copied and its excluded fields removed (using dictionary copying).
