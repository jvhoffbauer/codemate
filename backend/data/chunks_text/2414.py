- This endpoint uses a dependency with an exception raised in its generator function (`GeneratorRaiseException`) to simulate synchronous exceptions being thrown from dependencies. - The `OtherDependencyError` is caught by FastAPI's built-in error handling, which returns a JSON response containing details about the error and HTTP status codes indicating whether or not the request was successful. - By using this technique, we can test our application's ability to handle errors that may arise from external services or libraries without having to actually make network requests or interact with those services directly.
