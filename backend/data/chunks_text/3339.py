- Tests two scenarios for handling a hidden header in Flask requests using PyTest's `parametrize` decorator to generate multiple tests with different inputs and expected outputs. - The first scenario sends no custom headers and expects that the 'hidden_header' key is not present in the server's response JSON. - The second scenario adds a custom header named 'Hidden-Header', which should be converted into the 'hidden_header' key in the server's response JSON.
