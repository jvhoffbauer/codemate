- Converts a datetime object to ISO format with microseconds and time zone information removed, using Python's built-in `datetime` module and Django's `timezone` library. - This method is used for serializing datetime fields in Django REST Framework responses or requests, as it simplifies data transfer between different systems that may not support all datetime formats. - The resulting string can be easily parsed back into a datetime object by any system supporting ISO format without additional conversion steps required.
