- Defines a custom CRUD for `sqlalchemy` models using `FastAPI`'s built-in SQLAlchemy support and `Pydantic`'s `LabelField`.
- Registers the CRUD with the main application instance to make it available as an endpoint.
- Tests the generated OpenAPI documentation by accessing the API through the client and checking that expected data is returned.
- Verifies that specific fields are included or excluded from various parts of the API (e.g., list response, filter parameters, etc.).
