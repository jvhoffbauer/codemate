- Tests if a POST request to `/uploadfile/` endpoint is successful without any body (i.e., no file attached)
- Verifies that the server returns an HTTP status code of 200 and a JSON message indicating that there's no uploaded file

I hope this helps clarify what the test case is doing! Let me know if you have further questions or concerns.
