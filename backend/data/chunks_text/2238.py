- Defines a function `sub_duplicate_dependency` that takes two arguments `item` and an optional argument `sub_item`. The default value of `sub_item` is obtained using the `Depends()` decorator with another function called `duplicate_dependency`. - Inside the function body, both `item` and `sub_item` are returned as a list. This can be useful in scenarios where we want to include multiple dependencies or items in our application's dependency graph.
