- Defines a function `read_items` with a default argument for the parameter `q`. If `q` is not passed as an argument, it will be set to `Query(default=None)`, which returns None by default. This allows us to call the function without passing in `q` and still have some value assigned to that variable inside the function body. - The decorator `pragma: no cover` tells our test runner (pytest) to skip running this particular function during tests because we're not planning on testing its functionality here. It's just a helper method used elsewhere in the application.
