- This method allows seeking to a specific byte position within the file using an integer `offset`. - It returns `None`, indicating it's not used for anything other than side effects (moving the file pointer). - It's asynchronous and can be awaited, making it compatible with async/await syntax. - It delegates the actual work of seeking to its parent class `super()` while running in a background thread pool.
