- Defines a fixture `openapi_compatible` that checks whether the OpenAPI version used by Pydantic is compatible with the current test environment's supported versions. - If the Pydantic version is greater than or equal to 1.10.0, it creates a decorator function called `_openapi_compatible` that takes an object as input, converts its 'openapi' key from string to Any type, and returns the modified object. This allows us to avoid strict comparison of strings during testing. - Otherwise, it defines another implementation of `_openapi_compatible`, which recursively applies itself on nested dictionaries, removes the 'default' field from objects containing both 'const' and 'default', performs the same conversion as before, and finally returns the updated dictionary.
