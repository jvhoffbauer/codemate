- Automated test script using Playwright to interact with a local web application at http://localhost:8000/docs and capture a screenshot of a specific section (POST/items/Create Item > Schema tab). - Uses headless mode for Chrome by default but sets it to False in this case to show the browser window during execution. - Saves the captured screenshot as an image file named 'image01.png' under the 'docs/en/docs/img/' directory within the project root folder.
