- This function returns either the basic information about a specific dataset (specified by `src_path`) or a list of available assets for that dataset, depending on the values passed to arguments `asset_params`, `reader_params`, and `env`. - The returned data is formatted according to the `MultiBaseInfo` model defined elsewhere in the application. - If an error occurs during execution, one of several possible HTTP status codes will be returned instead, based on the specific error type.
