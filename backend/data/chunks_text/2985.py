- This function tests the GET request for retrieving a list of items from the server using Flask's built-in `client` object. - The expected status code is checked against the actual one returned by the server. If they don't match, an error message containing both values is raised. - The JSON response body is also compared to a predefined dictionary with the expected result. If there are any differences, another error message is generated.
