- Defines a function `method_request()` that takes two arguments: `json_request`, which is assumed to be an object with a `get()` method for making HTTP requests, and `add_path_postfix`, which is a boolean flag indicating whether or not to append a path postfix (i.e., a trailing slash) to the URL of each request made by this wrapper function. - Returns another function called `requester()`. This inner function accepts three arguments: `method`, which is the name of the RPC method being invoked; `params`, which is a dictionary containing any parameters required by the selected method; and `request_id`, which is an optional integer used as a unique identifier for this particular request. - The `requester()` function constructs a JSON-RPC request message using the provided values, including the specified ID, version number ("2.0"), method name, and parameter list. It then passes this message to the outer function's `json_request()` object along with an optional path postfix string derived from the value of `add_path_postfix`. - By returning the `requester()` function instead of executing its body directly, we create a closure around the local variables defined in the enclosing scope (namely, `json_request` and `add_path_postfix`) so they can still be accessed inside the nested function. This allows us to reuse the same `json_request()` object across multiple invocations of our customized RPC client while preserving the desired behavior regarding URL formatting.
