- Defines an `@app.route('/preview')` and `'/preview.<format>'` endpoints for generating previews of datasets using FastAPI's dependency injection system to pass arguments such as input file path, output format, rescaling parameters, color formulas, and colormaps. - Uses RasterIO library to read and manipulate geospatial data in various formats like GeoTIFF, NetCDF, etc., and generates previews based on user-defined layers, imagery settings, and rendering options. - Allows users to apply custom color formulas from Rio Color library and choose different colormaps for visualization purposes. - Provides flexibility in choosing output formats like JPEG, PNG, etc., depending on whether there are masked areas in the image.
