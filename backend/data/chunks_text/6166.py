- Defines a function called `get_settings` that uses the decorator `@functools.lru_cache()` to cache its results for future calls with the same arguments. - Takes keyword arguments (`**kwargs`) and returns an instance of `BaseSettings`, which is likely a class defined elsewhere in the application's configuration module. - Prints a log message using the `CFG_LOGGER` object, indicating that it's loading config settings from the environment. - Imports another module named `app.config`. This could be the main configuration module for this application, where `get_settings` might be used as part of initializing other components. The usage example shows how to call `get_settings` with optional parameters passed via keywords, such as specifying a custom `.env` file path.
