- This function is connected to the `@task_postrun` decorator using Celery's Flower integration (`flower`) to clear context variables after each task execution. - The `cleanup()` function takes keyword arguments as input and returns nothing (`None`). - Its purpose is to remove the value of the `correlation_id` variable from the context, preventing it from being accidentally used again during subsequent tasks executed by Celery workers.
