- Defines a function `get_path_param_lt` that takes an optional argument `item_id`, which is also used as a path parameter with a default value of `Path('lt', 3)`. - The `lt` in the path parameter name stands for "less than", indicating that this endpoint returns items whose IDs are less than the specified value (defaulting to 3). - This implementation allows developers to easily retrieve the desired subset of data without having to make multiple requests or filter results on their own, making it more efficient and user-friendly.
