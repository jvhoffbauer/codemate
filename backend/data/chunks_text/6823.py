- This function handles OAuth2 compatible token authentication and returns an access token for future API requests. - It takes a database connection (Session) as a dependency using FastAPI's `Depends` decorator to retrieve data from it. - The `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm` class is used to parse the request body containing the username and password fields. - If the provided credentials are incorrect or the user account is inactive, an error with status code 400 is raised. - An access token is generated using the `security.create_access_token` function, which includes the user ID and expiration time specified by the settings file. - The resulting dictionary contains both the access token and its type ("bearer").
