- Tests if a GET request to "/portal" with parameter "teleport" returns a temporary redirect (HTTP status code 307) and sets the location header to a specific YouTube video URL ("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ") without automatically following the redirection. - Uses Pytest's `TestClient` fixture from Flask's testing module for making requests against our application in a controlled environment. - Asserts that the HTTP status code of the response is equal to 307 and checks the value of the 'Location' header using Python's built-in assert statement.
