- Defines an asynchronous function `send_message()` that takes three arguments: context (a dictionary), user ID, and message string.
- Retrieves the user with the given ID from the database using SQLAlchemy's async `ORMUser.get()`.
- Converts the retrieved object into a regular Python class instance of type `User`, which is used for sending messages via some external messaging service (not implemented yet).
- Prints a log message containing the recipient's phone number and message content.
