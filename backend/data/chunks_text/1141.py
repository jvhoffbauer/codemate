- This function, named `read_own_items`, returns a list of dictionaries representing items owned by the currently authenticated user (retrieved using the `Depends(get_current_active_user)` decorator). - Each dictionary in the returned list contains an 'item_id' key and a 'owner' key with the value being the username of the current user. - The function is asynchronous due to the use of the `async` keyword before its definition.
