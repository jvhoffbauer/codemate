- This function `test_tutorial` is testing a module called `tutorial002_py310` in the `docs_src.tutorial` package using pytest's `clear_sqlmodel` fixture to clear SQLModel's metadata before each test. - The `create_engine` function from SQLAlchemy is used to create an engine for connecting to a SQLite database specified by the `sqlite_url`. - A mock object `new_print` is created and assigned to the built-in `print` function, which captures all print statements made during execution of the tested module (`mod.main()`) and stores them in a list called `calls`. - After executing the main function of the module being tested, we check if the expected output was printed by comparing the captured print statements with our expectations. In this case, we expect that the string 'Hero:' should be printed without any arguments passed to it.
