- Retrieves a dictionary of `InstrumentedAttribute` objects from an instance of a subclass of `TableModel`.
- The method takes as input the type (i.e., class) of the TableModel and returns a dictionary with keys being column names and values being their corresponding SQLAlchemy `InstrumentedAttribute` instances.
- This function is used to extract metadata about columns in a database table represented by a `TableModel` object without actually querying the database itself.
