- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items` that takes a dependency injection of an OAuth2 access token (`token`) from the `Depends()` decorator provided by FastAPI's dependency resolution system, and returns an object containing the token for use in subsequent requests to external APIs or services. - The returned dictionary is used to pass the authentication token downstream through middleware or other functions that require it, simplifying the process of handling authorization across multiple endpoints without having to repeat the same logic over and over again.
