- Tests that making a POST request to `/files/` without any body data returns a HTTP status code of 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and an error message indicating that the 'files' field is required. - Uses Pytest fixtures to automatically create a new instance of FastAPI's built-in testing client for each test case. - Imports necessary modules from Pytest and FastAPI. - Defines a function named `test_post_form_no_body` which takes in a single argument `client`, representing the testing client created by the fixture. - Makes a POST request to the specified URL using the `client` object and assigns its response to the variable `response`. - Asserts that the HTTP status code returned by the server matches our expected value of 422. - Extracts the JSON response from the server and asserts that it contains an error dictionary with a specific structure defined by Pydantic's validation errors.
