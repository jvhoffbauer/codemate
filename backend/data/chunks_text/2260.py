- This function is a unit test for the `GET /users/:userId` endpoint using Flask's built-in testing client (client). - It makes a GET request to retrieve user with ID 'rick', and asserts that the status code of the response is 200 OK. - If the status code is not 200, it also prints the text content of the response in debug mode for further inspection. - The JSON body of the response is then compared against an expected dictionary containing the requested user's ID ('rick') and path template ('/users/{user_id}' where {user_id} will be replaced by the actual value passed in the URL).
