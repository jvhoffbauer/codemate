- This function returns a variable called `session`, which is likely an object representing a user's current session in some application or web framework. - The name of this function, `get_session_override`, suggests that it may be used to provide a custom implementation for handling sessions instead of relying on the default behavior provided by the framework or library being used. - Since this function doesn't take any arguments and simply returns a value, it can potentially be called from other functions without passing any parameters.
