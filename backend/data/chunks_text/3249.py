- This function tests the `/dict` endpoint by making a GET request using Flask's built-in testing client (client). - The expected status code is checked against the actual status code returned by the server. If they don't match, an error message containing both codes and the response text is printed to help with debugging. - The JSON response from the server is compared to a dictionary literal representing the expected result. If there are any differences, an AssertionError will be raised.
