- This function handles a PATCH request to update an existing hero by ID using FastAPI's `@app.patch` decorator and returns the updated hero object (`HeroRead`) defined in the `response_model`.
- The function takes two arguments: `hero_id`, which is the primary key of the hero being updated, and `hero`, which contains the new values for the hero attributes that should be updated.
- Inside the function, we retrieve the database row corresponding to the given `hero_id` using SQLAlchemy's `Session` context manager. If the hero doesn't exist, we raise a `HTTPException` with status code 404.
- We then merge the incoming `hero` data into the retrieved `db_hero` instance using `marshmallow`'s `Model` class to convert between Python objects and JSON/dict formats.
- After updating the `db_hero` object, we add it back to the session, commit the changes, and refresh the object to ensure its state reflects any related objects or associations.
- Finally, we return the updated `db_hero` object.
