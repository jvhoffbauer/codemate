- Defines a base model `PersonBase`, which is inherited by two other models `Person` and `PersonCreate`.
- Enables ORM mode for all Pydantic classes using `Config.orm_mode = True`.
- Allows reading from database tables directly into Pydantic objects with `Config.read_with_orm_mode = True`.
- Creates an endpoint to create a new `Person` object, returning it as a subclass of `PersonBase` with additional fields filled in (`full_name`) based on its attributes.
- Uses the `TestClient` provided by FastAPI to make requests against the created server instance.
- Tests that creating a new `Person` returns the expected JSON representation, including both original input values and derived ones calculated at runtime.
