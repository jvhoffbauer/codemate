- This function is called `read_users`. It retrieves a list of users from the database using the `crud.user.get_multi` method provided by FastAPI's SQLAlchemy extension (`FastAPISQLAlchemy`). - The function takes three arguments with default values: `skip`, `limit`, and `current_user`. These parameters are used to paginate through the results and restrict access based on user authentication. - If no value is passed for `skip` or `limit`, they will be set to their defaults of 0 and 100 respectively. - The `Depends` decorator is applied to the `current_user` parameter, which allows us to pass in an instance of the currently authenticated superuser obtained via `get_current_active_superuser`.
