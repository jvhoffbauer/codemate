- Defines a new endpoint for receiving notifications about specific invoices using FastAPI's `Router` and decorators. - Uses path parameters to extract the ID of the relevant invoice from the URL. - Specifies the expected request body format (an instance of `InvoiceEvent`) using Pydantic's `response_model`. - Includes a placeholder function that doesn't actually perform any action, but is necessary to satisfy type hinting requirements in FastAPI.
