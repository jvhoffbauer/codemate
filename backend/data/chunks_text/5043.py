- Defines a GET route for the root URL (/) using FastAPI's `@bp.get()` decorator. - Returns an HTML response generated by passing arguments to Starlette's `templates.TemplateResponse()`. - Includes two named arguments in the function call: `"request"` and `"id"`, which are passed as context variables to the template engine. The former is provided automatically by FastAPI, while the latter is hardcoded here with a value of 1.
