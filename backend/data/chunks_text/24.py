- This method is called instead of `__init__()` for creating a new object using Python's metaclass mechanism. - It initializes the new object by calling its parent's constructor and then sets an internal flag called `__fields_set__`. - The reason for setting `__fields_set__` here is because SQLAlchemy skips calling the base class's `__init__()`, which means any fields added later through queries won't be included in it. By manually setting `__fields_set__` at this point with an empty set, we ensure that these additional fields will still be recognized as part of the object's state.
