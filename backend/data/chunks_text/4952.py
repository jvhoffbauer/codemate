- This method converts a custom exception class into an API response format using OpenAPI JSON Response (ORJSON). - It creates a dictionary `rv` with keys 'detail', 'code' and 'biz_code'. If any of these values are set in the exception object, they will be included in the dictionary. - The errors attribute is also added to the dictionary if it exists in the exception object. - Finally, the ORJSONResponse function is called passing the created dictionary as argument along with the HTTP status code from the exception object.
