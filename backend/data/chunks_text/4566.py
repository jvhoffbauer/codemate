- Defines a fixture named `client` using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called by PyTest when it encounters this fixture in tests that use it. - Inside the function, we first import the Flask application object (`app`) from a specific module (`docs_src.security.tutorial005_py39`) within our project. - We then create a new instance of Flask's built-in testing client (`TestClient`) with this imported `app`, and assign it to the variable `client`. - Finally, we return this newly created `client` object so that other test functions can access it via the `client` fixture name.
