- This function tests the `/path/int/{item_id}` endpoint with an invalid input for item ID (a decimal number). - It sends a GET request and checks that the server returns a HTTP status code of 422 (Unprocessable Entity) indicating that the input data was malformed or incorrectly formatted. - The JSON response body contains an error message detailing the specific issue with the input value ("Input should be a valid integer..."), including its location in the URL path ('path' and 'item_id') and the original input value ('42.5').
