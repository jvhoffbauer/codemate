- Defines a property called `route_update` that returns a callable function named `route`. This function is an asynchronous view function for handling PUT requests to update specific items identified by their IDs. - The signature of the `route` function takes three arguments: `Request`, `item_id`, and `data`. These parameters are decorated with `@annotations` from FastAPI's built-in `Body` and `Path` functions to automatically validate them based on their types. - Before updating any items, this function checks whether the user has permission to perform the operation using the `has_update_permission` method. If access is denied, it returns an error response. - After checking permissions, the function calls the `on_update_pre` method to handle any preprocessing logic before saving changes to the database. If no updates were made during this step, it returns an error response. - Finally, the function saves the updated items in the database using the `update_items` method and returns a simple JSON response containing the number of affected rows.
