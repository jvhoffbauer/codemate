- This function tests the `GET /query/int` endpoint with a query parameter named 'query' containing the value 'baz'. - The expected behavior is that the server returns HTTP status code 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and a JSON error message indicating that the input cannot be parsed as an integer due to its non-numeric nature ('baz'). - The error message includes details such as the type of validation failure ("int_parsing" in this case), the location within the request body where the issue was detected ("query", "query"), and a descriptive explanation of what went wrong ("unable to parse string as an integer").
