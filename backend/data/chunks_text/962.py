- Defines a function `copy_field_info` that takes two arguments: `field_info`, which is an instance of `FieldInfo`, and `annotation`, which can be any Python object representing annotations for this field. - The function returns a new instance of `FieldInfo` created using its class method `from_annotation`. This allows us to create a new `FieldInfo` object with updated annotations without modifying the original one.
