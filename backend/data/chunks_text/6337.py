- Defines a fixture named `event_loop` with session scope using pytest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - Creates a new asynchronous event loop (asyncio) and assigns it to the variable `loop`. - Sets the global event loop for all coroutines in this test session using `asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)`. - Yields the created event loop, making it available to other fixtures or tests that require an event loop. - Closes the event loop after the testing is complete by calling its `close()` method.
