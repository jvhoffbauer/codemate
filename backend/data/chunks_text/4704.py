- This function tests the `POST /uploadfile/` endpoint by uploading a file using the `files` parameter in the request body. - The temporary directory (`tmp_path`) is used to create and write the contents of the file being uploaded. - After successfully uploading the file, the function checks that the server returns an HTTP status code of 200 OK and verifies that the filename provided in the JSON response matches the name of the uploaded file.
