- Defines a property called `AnnotatedSelect` that returns an instance of `Annotated`, which is a type hinting and validation decorator in FastAPI.
- The returned value is a combination of `Select` (a SQLAlchemy query object) and `Depends` (a function that retrieves dependencies for use within functions). This allows for automatic dependency injection when using this property in FastAPI endpoints.
- The `_select_maker` attribute is assumed to be a method or function that creates the necessary SQLAlchemy query based on some input parameters.
