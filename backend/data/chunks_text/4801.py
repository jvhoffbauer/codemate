- Takes a sequence of either Enums or strings as input and returns a new list with all string representations of enums converted to their values. - The function iterates over each item in the input sequence using a generator expression (a type of list comprehension). - If an item is an enum, its value is extracted using the `__values__` attribute and passed through the built-in `str()` function to convert it to a string representation. - Otherwise, the item is already a string so we just pass it through `str()`. - Finally, the resulting list of strings is returned.
