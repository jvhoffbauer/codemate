- This is a unit test for the `docs_src/tutorial/where` module using SQLAlchemy's `create_engine` and `SQLModel` to interact with an in-memory SQLite database. - The `test_tutorial` function takes a context manager called `clear_sqlmodel`, which likely clears any existing data or tables before running the tests. - The `get_testing_print_function` function is used to capture all print statements made during execution of the tested module (in this case, `mod.main()`) into a list called `calls`.
