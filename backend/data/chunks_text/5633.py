- This method is defined inside a class (presumably a subclass of `Model`) and returns a string value.
- The returned string is based on the name of the current class, which can be accessed using the `__class__` attribute.
- This method may be used to generate unique database table names or other identifiers by prefixing them with the name of the model class.
