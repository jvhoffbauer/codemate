- Defines a new subclass `safe_datetime` of Python's built-in `datetime`. This is done to ensure that our custom encoder can handle this specific type of datetime object. - Creates a new model called `MyModel`, which has one field (`dt_field`) of type `safe_datetime`. - Initializes an instance of `MyModel` with some data and passes it through `jsonable_encoder()` along with a dictionary containing our custom encoder for the `safe_datetime` type. The value assigned to the key `safe_datetime` in this dictionary is a function that converts the datetime object into its ISO format string representation. - Asserts that the resulting JSON output contains the expected ISO format string instead of the default datetime string representation.
