- Defines a function `test_a` to test endpoint `/a`.
- Makes an HTTP GET request using Flask's built-in `client` object and stores the response in variable `response`.
- Asserts that the status code of the response is equal to 200 (OK) and saves the text content for debugging purposes.
- Uses Python's built-in `assert` statement to check if the JSON payload returned by the server matches the expected value 'a'.
