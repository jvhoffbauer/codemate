- This function tests a tutorial in SQLAlchemy's documentation by running it and checking if the expected print statements are called using `get_testing_print_function`.
- The `test_tutorial` function takes a context manager `clear_sqlmodel`, which is used to clear the SQLModel registry before each test case.
- The function imports the necessary classes for the tutorial (`app` and `database`) and sets up the SQLite connection string and engine.
- It then patches the built-in `print` function with a custom implementation that records the printed messages in a list of calls.
- Finally, the main application is started inside this patched environment, and the recorded calls are compared against an expected list of prints.
