- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()` that takes multiple optional arguments for filtering and sorting items based on their processing requirements.
- Converts some of these arguments (e.g., datetime objects) to Pydantic models using the `Annotated` decorator from FastAPI's built-in ORM library Starlette.
- Calculates derived values such as `start_process` and `duration`, which are added to the returned dictionary along with the original input parameters.
