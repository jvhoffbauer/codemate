- Tests authentication with a token that doesn't have the required `sub` (subject) claim for accessing user information. - Sends an HTTP GET request to the `/users/me` endpoint with the provided authorization header and expects a 401 Unauthorized status code. - Verifies that the server returns the expected error message in the body of the response and sets the WWW-Authenticate header to indicate that Bearer tokens are required with the necessary scopes ('scope="me"').
