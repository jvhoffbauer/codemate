- This function imports a specific HTML file (named `html`) from another module in the project's `docs_src.websockets.tutorial003_py39` directory, and returns it as a string. - The purpose of this function is to provide a reusable way to retrieve the same HTML content without having to copy/paste it multiple times throughout the application or tests. - It follows the principle of separation of concerns by encapsulating the retrieval logic into its own function instead of hardcoding it directly where it's needed.
