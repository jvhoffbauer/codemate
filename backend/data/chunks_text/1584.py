- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()` that takes a query parameter (optional) with default value and minimum length of 3 characters. - Queries a database or API to retrieve items based on the provided query, returning a dictionary containing the list of items and any matching search terms in a separate key called 'q'. - If no query is provided, returns just the list of items without the 'q' key.
