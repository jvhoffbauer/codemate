- Defines a function `client` that sets up and tears down a Flask test client for tutorial002 in custom_docs_ui package. - Creates a directory called'static' at the current working directory (CWD). - Prints the path of the newly created directory to verify its creation. - Makes sure the directory exists before creating it using exist_ok flag. - Imports the Flask application object defined in tutorial002 module. - Uses the context manager `with TestClient(app) as client:` to create a new instance of FlaskTestClient, which is used to make requests against our Flask application. - Yields the client object back to the caller so that we can use it inside other functions or blocks. - Removes the'static' directory after testing is complete.
