- Creates a secondary index named "idx_type" in the specified Couchbase bucket using N1QL (Couchbase Query Language) to efficiently search for documents based on their type field. - The `ignore_exists` parameter is set to True to avoid errors if the index already exists. - The `fields` parameter specifies that the index should be created based on the value of the 'type' field in each document.
