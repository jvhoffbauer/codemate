- Defines a generator function called `event_loop` that returns an asynchronous event loop (`asyncio.AbstractEventLoop`) and takes no arguments or return values. - Inside the generator body, creates a new event loop using the default policy's `new_event_loop()` method and assigns it to the local variable `loop`. - Yields the newly created event loop for use in other coroutines within this context manager. - After all coroutines have completed execution, closes the event loop using its `close()` method before returning from the generator.
