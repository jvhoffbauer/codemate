- This function tests a single method (`probe`) with different arguments and saves the responses in separate variables `resp1`, `resp2`, and `resp3`. - The responses are then compared to expected results using an assert statement that checks if both lists contain the same elements. - The `request_id` parameter is used as a unique identifier for each request.
