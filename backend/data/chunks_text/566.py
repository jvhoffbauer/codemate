- Imports `test_tutorial` function and `create_engine` function from SQLAlchemy library.
- Defines a variable called `mod` to store the imported module containing the tutorial's implementation.
- Sets the value of `mod.sqlite_url` to a string representing an SQLite database URL.
- Creates an engine using the `create_engine` function and assigns it to `mod.engine`.
- Initializes a list called `calls` that will be used later for testing output.
- Retrieves the built-in print function and replaces it temporarily with a custom one that saves each printed statement in the `calls` list.
- Calls the main function of the tutorial module stored in `mod`, passing the modified print function as an argument.
- Asserts that the `calls` list contains the expected statements after running the tutorial.
