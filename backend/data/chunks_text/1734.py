- This endpoint sends a notification with a customizable message to an email address specified in the URL path parameter `{email}`. - It uses FastAPI's built-in dependency injection mechanism (`Depends`) to retrieve query parameters from the request body using the `get_query()` function. - The actual sending of the notification is delegated to a background task using the `BackgroundTasks` object provided by FastAPI's background tasks extension. - A log message containing the notification content is also written asynchronously using another background task created via the same `BackgroundTasks` object.
