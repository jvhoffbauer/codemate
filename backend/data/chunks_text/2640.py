- Defines a function `read_explicit_query` that takes an optional argument `q`, which can be either a string or `None`. - If `q` is not provided (i.e., it's `None`), sets its value to an empty query object created using the built-in `Query()` function from some library like SQLAlchemy. - Returns the resulting query object regardless of whether it was passed in as an argument or generated by the default value.
