- Generates a unique filename for an uploaded file using `uuid.uuid4()`.
- Removes hyphens from the generated uuid string to make it easier to use as part of the filename.
- Splits the original filename into its base name and extension using `os.path.splitext()`, then appends the extension back onto the new filename created with the uuid and current year/month in ISO format.
