- This function tests the `tutorial004` module in the SQLAlchemy tutorial section using pytest's `clear_sqlmodel` fixture to clear any existing database connections. - It imports and sets up the necessary variables for running the `tutorial004` module, including creating a new engine instance. - It creates a mock print function (using `get_testing_print_function`) that captures all printed output during execution of the module. - It patches the built-in `print` function with this mock function and runs the main function of the module. - Finally, it checks if the captured output matches the expected output by comparing against an array called `expected_calls`.
