- Initializes a logging configuration for all tests in the session using PyTest's `autouse` and `scope` fixtures. - Defines a custom filter called 'correlation_id', which adds a unique identifier to each log message generated by the 'asgi_correlation_id' logger. This allows logs from different requests or tasks to be easily distinguished. - Also defines another custom filter called 'celery_tracing_ids', which extracts tracing IDs (if present) from Celery messages and includes them in the log output. - Uses these filters along with a formatted string template to create detailed log messages that include correlation IDs, parent/child task IDs, and any relevant tracing information. - Sets up a console handler with both filters applied, so that all logged messages are displayed with this richer contextual data during testing.
