- This function tests the batch notification feature by sending two echo requests with different data and verifying that both responses are received in a single call using batch notation. - The `raw_request()` method is used to simulate an HTTP request without actually making one, allowing for easier testing of server behavior. - The history of messages sent through the Echo service (represented by the `echo` object) is checked after the request completes to ensure all expected messages were delivered.
