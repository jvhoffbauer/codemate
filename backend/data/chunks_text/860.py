- Defines a function called `decorator` that takes in a decorated callable (a function with a decorator applied to it) as an argument and returns it. - Inside the function, adds an exception handler using the `self.add_exception_handler()` method for a specific exception class or status code passed as an argument. - Returns the original decorated callable without modifying its behavior.
