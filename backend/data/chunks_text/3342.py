- This function uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` to define multiple tests with different input values for a single function call.
- The first argument of each tuple in the list passed to `parametrize` is used as the value for the parameter named by the second argument ("path" in this case).
- The third argument of each tuple contains the expected output values for that set of inputs. In this example, we're testing an API endpoint called `/hidden_query`, which takes a query string parameter called `hidden_query`. We want to make sure it returns the correct JSON response based on whether or not the query parameter is present and what its value is. By using `parametrize`, we can run two separate tests with different values for the query parameter without having to duplicate the setup code for making requests to the server.
