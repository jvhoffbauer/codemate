- Defines a function `path_convertor` that takes an optional argument `param` of type `Path`. If not provided, it defaults to the current working directory represented by the built-in Python module `Path`. - Returns a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the value is the input parameter `param`, and the key is "path". This can be useful for converting a file or folder path into a format suitable for passing as a request body in an API call, for example.
