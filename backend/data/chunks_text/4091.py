- Defines a fixture named `html` for use in pytests by calling another module's variable `html`.
- The `get_html()` function is not explicitly defined, but rather referenced using the `from... Import` statement to access its value.
- This approach allows reusing existing HTML content without duplicating it within test files or fixtures.
