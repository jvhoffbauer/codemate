- Tests that making a `PUT` request to an item without providing either query parameter 'token' or header 'X-Token' results in a HTTP status code of 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and an error message containing details about both missing fields. - The error message is formatted according to Pydantic's validation error format for Python 3.9+ (IsDict with nested dictionaries representing each validation error), as well as the legacy format used by older versions of Pydantic (IsDict with a single dictionary representing all errors).
