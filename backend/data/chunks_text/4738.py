- Defines a fixture named `app` for use in pytests using Flask's application factory pattern to create and return an instance of the Flask app defined in tutorial002_an_py39.py under request_files directory within docs_src package. - Allows easy access to this app object during tests without having to repeatedly instantiate it, improving test efficiency and reducing duplication of code.
