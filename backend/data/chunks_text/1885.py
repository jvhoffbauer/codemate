- This function is a GET request for all items (`"/items/"`) in our application, and returns a list of `Item` objects as JSON response. - The `read_items()` function creates an empty list called `[]`, then iteratively adds two new `Item` instances into it using dictionary unpacking syntax. Each item has its own unique `name` and `description`. - These `Item` objects are returned by the function when the endpoint is accessed via HTTP GET request.
