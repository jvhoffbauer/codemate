- Tests if the OpenAPI schema can be retrieved successfully with a status code of 200 and returns the expected JSON format containing information about FastAPI's version, title, paths (including GET request for /items), responses, summary, and operation ID. - Uses the `client` object to make an HTTP GET request to '/openapi.json'. - Asserts that the response status code is equal to 200 and checks the text content in case of failure. - Verifies that the returned JSON matches the expected structure by comparing it against a dictionary literal using Python's built-in `assert`.
