1. This function takes a `type_`, `is_filter`, and optional `required` parameter as input and returns a dictionary representing the Amis form item type based on the given Pydantic model field type.
2. It first determines the outer type of the provided `type_`. If it's either `str` or `Any`, it sets the `type` key to `"input-text"`.
3. For enumerated types like `Enum`, it creates options using the choices or values/labels pairs and sets the `type` key to `"select"` with additional properties such as `clearable` and `extractValue`.
4. For boolean types, it sets the `type` key to `"switch"`.
5. For filtering purposes, it handles different subclasses of `datetime` by setting appropriate keys such as `"type"`, `"format"`, and `"ranges"`.
6. For integer and floating point numbers, it sets the `type` key to `"input-number"` with specific precision and validation settings.
7. For date and time classes derived from Python's built-in `datetime` module, it sets the corresponding `type` key along with format strings.
8. For JSON data structures represented by `Json` or nested models represented by `BaseModel`, it uses the `"json-editor"` and `"input-sub-form"` respectively, passing down necessary configuration parameters.
