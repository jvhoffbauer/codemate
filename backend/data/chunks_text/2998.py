- Defines a function `router_depends` that takes an optional argument `commons`, which is a dictionary returned by the `Depends()` decorator applied to the `common_parameters` variable. - The function returns an object with two keys, 'in' and 'params', where 'in' has a value of 'router-depends' (a string) and 'params' contains the contents of the `commons` dictionary passed as an argument. This pattern allows for easy passing of common parameters between routes in FastAPI applications using dependency injection.
