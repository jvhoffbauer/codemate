- Defines a function `validate` that takes two arguments: `src_path` and `strict`. The former is required (marked with `Depends`) and has a default value provided by `factory.path_dependency`, while the latter is optional (marked with `Query`) and defaults to False. - Returns an object called `cog_info` which contains information about the validity of the COG at the given path. This can be used for error handling or other purposes related to COG validation. - If `strict` is True, any warnings during validation will be treated as errors. Otherwise, they will be ignored.
