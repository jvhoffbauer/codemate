- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()` that takes a default list of strings called `q`.
- Uses Pydantic's `Query` class to parse and validate user input for the `q` parameter, with a default value of ["foo", "bar"].
- Returns a dictionary called `query_items`, which contains a key-value pair where the key is 'q', and the value is the parsed and validated `q` parameter.
