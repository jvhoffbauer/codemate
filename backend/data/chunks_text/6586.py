- This function `probe2()` takes two arguments, an authentication token (`auth_token`) and a dependency value (`probe2_dep`) that is retrieved using another function called `get_probe2_dep()`.
- The `Depends()` decorator is used to pass these dependencies into the function.
- Inside the function body, both `auth_token` and `probe2_dep` are deleted using the `del` statement, indicating they will not be used in this context.
- Finally, the function returns an integer value of 1.
