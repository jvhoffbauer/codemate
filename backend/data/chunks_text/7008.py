- This function `get_item()` retrieves a specific item from the database using FastAPI's dependency injection and SQLAlchemy's CRUD functions. - It takes two arguments: `db`, which is an instance of the SQLAlchemy session provided by the `Depends` decorator, and `id`, which is the unique identifier for the desired item. - If the requested item cannot be found in the database, it raises a customized HTTP exception with status code 404 (Not Found).
