- Creates a new user with a randomly generated email and password using `random_email()` and `random_lower_string()`. - Sets the user's superuser flag to `True`, but asserts that it will be set to `False` in the database after creation (likely due to some logic in the CRUD function). - Enables the user's account by setting its active flag to `True`. - Makes an API request to create the new user at `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/open` and checks for a successful response status code between 200 and 299 inclusive.
