- This function takes a parameter `dep_a` of type `DepA`, which is an instance of class `DepA`. The `@Depends` decorator injects an instance of `DependencyA` into this argument when calling the function. - Inside the function, we create an object called `dep_b` using `generate_dep_b()`. - We use a context manager to ensure that `dep_b` is properly closed and released after it's used in the function body. The `close()` method takes `dep_a` as its argument, indicating that the resource being managed by `dep_a` should be cleaned up before closing `dep_b`.
