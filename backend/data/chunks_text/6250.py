- Defines a class fixture named `mock_client_session_class` using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator with scope set to "class". - Exposes an `AsyncMock` object called `httputils.CLIENT_SESSION` to all test cases in the current class by setting it as a class attribute and initializing it inside the fixture function. - Sets up a mock for the `get` method of `httputils.CLIENT_SESSION`. - Cleans up the `httputils.CLIENT_SESSION` variable after the fixture is executed, ensuring that other tests don't accidentally use this mock.
