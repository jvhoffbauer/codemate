- This function is a GET request handler for the "/route3" endpoint in our FastAPI application. - It uses the `@app.get()` decorator to register this function as a route. - The `async def` syntax indicates that it's an asynchronous function, which allows us to use awaitable objects like `time.sleep()`. - We pass a `Response` object (from FastAPI's built-in `responses` module) into the function signature and assign it to the variable `response`. - Inside the function body, we simulate a delay of one second using `time.sleep()`, then set a custom server timing header called "atime". - Finally, we return a simple string message.
