- Defines an asynchronous function called `websocket_endpoint` that takes a WebSocket object (`websocket`) and two optional arguments: `item_id`, which is a string representing the ID of the item being accessed, and `q`, which is an integer used to filter results. - The `Depends` decorator is applied to the `cookie_or_token` argument, indicating that it will be passed through a dependency resolver before being passed into this function. This allows us to easily retrieve the session cookie or token from another part of our application without having to pass it explicitly here. - Inside the loop, we first accept the incoming connection using `await websocket.accept()`. Then, in each iteration, we receive some text message sent by the client via `await websocket.receive_text()`. We then send back various pieces of information based on the received message and the provided arguments. Specifically, we return the current value of `cookie_or_token`, the value of `q` (if provided), and details about the received message itself, including its contents and the associated item ID.
