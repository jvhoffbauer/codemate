- Defines a fixture named `client` using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called by PyTest when it needs an instance of the `client`. - Inside the `get_function()`, we first import the Flask application defined in `docs_src/schema_extra_example/tutorial001.py`. - We then create a new instance of the `TestClient` class provided by the `flask_testing` library and pass our Flask application as its constructor argument. - Finally, we return the newly created `client` object so that it can be used inside tests that use this fixture.
