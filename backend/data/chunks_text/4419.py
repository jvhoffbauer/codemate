- Defines a fixture named `client` using pytest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called by pytest before each test that uses it. - Inside the fixture, we first import the Flask application defined in `docs_src/path_operation_configuration/tutorial005_py310.py`. - We then create a new instance of the `TestClient` class provided by the Flask testing library and pass our imported Flask application as an argument. - Finally, we return the newly created `TestClient` object so that it can be used inside tests that use this fixture.
