- Defines a function `create_access_token` that takes in a dictionary of user data and an optional time delta for token expiration as arguments. - Copies the input dictionary into a new variable called `to_encode`. - If an expiration time is provided, sets it as the value of the "exp" key in `to_encode`. Otherwise, defaults to a 15 minute expiry. - Encodes the updated dictionary using the JWT library's `encode` method with the secret key and specified algorithm (in this case, HS256). - Returns the resulting JWT string.
