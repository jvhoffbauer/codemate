- Creates a temporary directory using PyTest's TempPathFactory and sets it as the current working directory (CWD). - Initializes a variable for the path of the SQLite database used by the application under test ("SQL_APP.DB"). - Checks whether the database file exists, deletes it if found, and then imports the necessary module containing the main function of the application. - Reloads the imported module to ensure that any side effects during import execution are executed again before running tests. - Yields an instance of Flask's TestClient class, which is used to make requests against the application being tested. - After testing, checks whether the database file still exists, deletes it if found, and restores the original CWD.
