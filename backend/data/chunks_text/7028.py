- Retrieves the currently authenticated user using FastAPI's `Depends()` function to pass the `models.User` object returned by the `get_current_active_user()` method from the `deps` module as an argument for the endpoint's parameter `user`. - Returns the retrieved user data in a JSON format with the help of the `response_model` decorator, which specifies that the expected output is of type `schemas.User`, defined elsewhere in the application.
