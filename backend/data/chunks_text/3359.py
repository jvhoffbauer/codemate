- This function tests a non-existent endpoint by making an HTTP GET request to "/nonexistent" using Flask's built-in `client`. - The expected status code is 404 (Not Found), which is checked with the `assert` statement. - If the status code is not as expected, the error message from the server is retrieved and printed for debugging purposes. - Additionally, the JSON response body is also checked to ensure it contains the correct error detail ("Not Found").
