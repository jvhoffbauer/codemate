- This function is a dependency function that takes in a `refresh_token` dictionary as an argument and returns a user object. - It uses the `valid_refresh_token` dependency to validate the refresh token's expiration time and signature. - If the validation passes, it retrieves the associated user from the database using the `service` module and raises a custom exception (`RefreshTokenNotValid`) if the user doesn't exist.
