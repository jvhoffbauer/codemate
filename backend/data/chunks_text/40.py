- This method calculates a set of keys to be included in the JSON representation based on user input and internal settings.
- It takes several optional arguments for customization, including an `include` mapping that specifies which fields should definitely be included, an `exclude` mapping that specifies which fields should not be included (even if they would otherwise meet inclusion criteria), an `exclude_unset` flag indicating whether unset values should also be excluded, and an `update` dictionary containing additional key-value pairs to add to the output.
- The resulting set of keys is returned as an abstract set type (either frozenset or set) for efficient lookup during serialization.
