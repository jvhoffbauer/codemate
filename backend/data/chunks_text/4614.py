- This function tests if an inactive user is returned a 400 Bad Request error when trying to retrieve their profile using an access token generated with valid credentials. - The `get_access_token()` function from Flask-JWT-Extended is used to generate the access token for Alice's account. - If the status code of the HTTP request is not equal to 400 and the JSON response doesn't contain the expected detail message ("Inactive user"), then the test fails.
