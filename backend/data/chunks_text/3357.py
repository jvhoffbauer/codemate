- Generates an OpenAPI schema for a FastAPI application using `pydantic` and `fastapi`.
- Tests the generated schema by making a GET request to the `/openapi.json` endpoint of the app.
- Verifies that the status code is 200 and the JSON response matches the expected structure with placeholders filled in (e.g., title, version).
- Checks that the paths section contains the correct route information and responses, including summary, operation ID, security requirements, etc.
- Confirms that the components section includes the necessary security scheme definitions.
