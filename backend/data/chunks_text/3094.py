- Defines a function `example_examples()` that takes an argument `item`, which is of type `Item`. The default value for this parameter is set using the `Body()` class, with two nested dictionaries containing data called 'example' and 'examples'. - The 'example' dictionary contains a single key-value pair where the value is overwritten by passing it as an argument to the function call. This means that if we don't pass in a new 'example' dictionary when calling the function, the one defined here will be used instead. - The 'examples' list contains multiple dictionaries, each representing an individual example. These can also be passed into the function separately or left at their defaults.
