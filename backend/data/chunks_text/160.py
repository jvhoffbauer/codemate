- Defines a function called `select` with four arguments (`entity_0`, `entity_1`, `__ent2`, and `__ent3`) that are annotated as generic types using underscores (_). The first two arguments are scalar values of unspecified types (`_TScalar_0` and `_TScalar_1`), while the last two arguments represent contiguous arrays (`_TCCA`) of types `_T2` and `_T3`. - Returns a new object called `Select` which is a tuple containing all four input arguments along with their respective types (`Tuple[_TScalar_0, _TScalar_1, _T2, _T3]`). This allows for more specific typing in downstream operations involving this result.
