- This function is an asynchronous coroutine that takes a `state` dictionary argument, which is passed to it by the `Depends` decorator from FastAPI's dependency injection system. - The `context_b` key in this dictionary represents the value returned by another dependency (`get_context_b`) that was injected into our application using the same `Depends` decorator. - If the value of `context_b` in the `state` dictionary is not equal to "started b", then we raise a custom exception called `OtherDependencyError`.
