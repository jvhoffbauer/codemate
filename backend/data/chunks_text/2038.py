- This function is a decorator for the `Files` class that modifies its behavior during document generation. - It takes two arguments: `files`, which represents the current set of files being processed by MkDocs, and `config`, which contains configuration options specified by the user. - The function first calls another helper function called `resolve_files()` to add items from the `nav` list (if present), as well as any other custom lists provided by the user via the `extra_css` and `extra_javascript` keys in the configuration dictionary. - After this, it checks whether the theme configuration includes a logo image and/or favicon icon, and uses `resolve_file()` to include them in the output directory if they exist. - Finally, it returns the modified `Files` object with all the additional resources included.
