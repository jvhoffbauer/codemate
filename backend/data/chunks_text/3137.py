- This function tests the `GET /items/coerce` endpoint using Flask's built-in testing client (client) and asserts that the expected JSON response is returned with specific keys and values. - The `response.raise_for_status()` method raises an exception if the HTTP status code of the response is not in the range of success codes (2xx), which helps to ensure that errors are handled correctly during testing.
