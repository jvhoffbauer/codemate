- Allows parallel execution of tests for faster testing times (set by `--parallel-mode` flag).
- Specifies directories to include in the test coverage calculation (set by `--source` flag).
- Executes a specific Python module (specified by `-m`) within the given working directory (specified by `cwd` argument).
- Returns the output of the command as a completed process object (stored in `result` variable) which can be accessed later if needed.
