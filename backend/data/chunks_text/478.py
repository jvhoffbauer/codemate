- This is a unit test for `docs_src/tutorial/where.py`, specifically for the `tutorial002_py310` module. - It sets up an SQLAlchemy engine and patches the built-in print function to capture its output during execution of the tested module's main function. - The test checks that the expected data is returned by two separate queries using the WHERE clause in SQLAlchemy ORM statements.
