- This function tests the `tutorial002_py310` module in the `docs_src/tutorial/connect/select` directory using pytest's `clear_sqlmodel` fixture to clear any existing SQLModel sessions and connections before running each test case. - The `import` statement imports the specific module being tested, which contains a main function for executing the tutorial steps. - The `sqlite_url` attribute is set on the imported module, followed by creating an engine instance using the `create_engine` function provided by SQLAlchemy. - A list called `calls` is initialized to store the output of the `print` statements during execution. - The `get_testing_print_function` function from pytest is used to replace the built-in `print` function with a custom implementation that adds the printed message to the `calls` list instead of actually printing it to the console. - The patched `print` function is then passed into the context manager created by `patch`, allowing us to capture all print statements made within the `with` block. - Finally, we call the main function of the module under test inside the `with` block, and after exiting the block, we check if the captured `print` statements match our expectations (stored in the `expected_calls` variable).
