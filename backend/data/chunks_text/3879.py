- Defines a fixture named `client` using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called when the fixture is invoked in tests. - Inside the fixture definition, we first import the Flask application object (`app`) from the module where it's defined (`docs_src.body_multiple_params.tutorial003`). - We then create a new instance of Flask's built-in test client (`TestClient`) with our application as its argument. - Finally, we return the newly created `TestClient` instance so that it can be used by other functions or classes that depend on this fixture.
