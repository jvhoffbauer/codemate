- Defines a function `send_notification` that takes an email address as input and returns a dictionary with a success message. - Uses FastAPI's built-in dependency injection to pass a `BackgroundTasks` object to the function for adding tasks to be executed in the background using Celery. - Adds a new task to the queue using the `add_task()` method of the `BackgroundTasks` object, passing the email address and a message as arguments to the `write_notification()` function (assumed to exist).
