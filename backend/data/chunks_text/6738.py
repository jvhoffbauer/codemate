- Defines a decorator `capture_exceptions` that uses Python's built-in `unittest.mock` module (specifically its `MonkeyPatch` class) to replace Sentry SDK's `Hub.capture_event` method with a custom implementation during test execution. - The custom implementation saves all exceptions raised by the decorated function and their corresponding tracebacks in a set called `errors`. - It also preserves the original behavior of `Hub.capture_event` for other events using a closure around the original method.
