- Defines a `UserCrud` object with an `id` and `username` filter for the SQLAlchemy CRUD operations. - Registers the crud to the main application using its prefix. - Asserts that the expected fields are included in the schema filters and excluded from the user's password field. - Tests the API endpoints by passing different query parameters (ID or username) and verifying the returned data matches expectations.
