- Imports a specific module and function from the `docs_src.tutorial` package for testing purposes. - Sets up SQLAlchemy's connection URL and engine based on the imported module's configuration. - Creates a mock print function to capture output during execution of the main function in the imported module. - Patches the built-in print function with the created mock function using Python's unittest.mock library. - Executes the main function in the imported module while capturing its output through the mock print function. - Asserts that the captured output matches the expected output by comparing it against an array of strings called `expected_calls`.
