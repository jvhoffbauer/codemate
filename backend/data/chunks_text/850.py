- Adds a new WebSocket route to the FastAPI router for handling API requests using the `add_api_websocket_route()` method provided by FastAPI's built-in `Router` class. - The `path`, `endpoint`, and (optionally) `name` arguments are passed directly to `add_api_websocket_route()`. - The `dependencies` argument is also optional and allows passing in any required dependencies or middleware functions that should be applied before executing the endpoint function.
