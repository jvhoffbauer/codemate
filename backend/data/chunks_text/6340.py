- This function is a pytest fixture that checks if the environment variable `config.settings.ENVIRONMENT` equals 'PYTEST' to ensure that the database connection uses the testing configuration (i.e., `TEST_DB`) instead of production or development configurations. - The fixture drops and recreates the database schema before each test, ensuring that all tests run in an isolated state without any leftover data from previous tests affecting the results.
