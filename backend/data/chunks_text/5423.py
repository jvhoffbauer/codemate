- Defines a function `bounds()` that takes several dependencies (`src_path`, `backend_params`, `reader_params`, and `env`) using FastAPI's dependency injection system. - Uses RasterIO to open the dataset at the specified path (`src_path`) with specific options for both the backend and reader parameters passed in through their respective dependencies. - Returns an object containing the geographic bounds of the opened dataset.
