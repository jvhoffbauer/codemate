- Defines a fixture named `client` using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called by PyTest when it needs an instance of the `client`. - Inside the `get_function()`, we first import the Flask application object (`app`) from our tutorial example located in `docs_src/schema_extra_example/tutorial001_pv1`. - We then create a new instance of Starlette's built-in testing client (`TestClient`) with our imported Flask application as its argument. - Finally, we return the newly created `client` instance for use in other tests that require access to our API server.
