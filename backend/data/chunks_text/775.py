- Defines an `execute` function that takes a SQL query (either INSERT or UPDATE statement) and executes it using the AsyncEngineConnection object returned by the begin method of the database connection pool. - The function returns nothing, indicating that it is used to perform side effects rather than returning any value. - Uses the `async` keyword before the function definition to indicate that this function can be called from within an async context manager like an event loop.
