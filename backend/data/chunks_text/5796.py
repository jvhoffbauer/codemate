- Defines a method called `handle` that takes in three arguments: a `Request`, a `SchemaUpdateT` object representing the updated schema, and any additional keyword arguments (`**kwargs`) passed to the function. - The method returns an instance of `BaseApiOut` with the updated schema as its payload (`data`). This is done using the `BaseApiOut` class provided by FastAPI's built-in ORM library, SQLAlchemy. By returning this type of response, we can easily integrate our API with other tools like Swagger or Redoc for documentation purposes.
