- Imports `tutorial001_py39` module from `docs_src/tutorial/relationship_attributes/back_populates` directory and assigns it to a variable named `mod`.
- Sets SQLAlchemy connection URL for testing purposes using `sqlite://` syntax.
- Creates an instance of SQLAlchemy engine using the set URL.
- Defines a list called `calls` that will be used later in the function to store print statements made during execution.
- Retrieves the built-in Python `print()` function and replaces its behavior by creating a mock object called `new_print`, which stores all printed messages into the `calls` list instead of displaying them on the console.
- Wraps the main function of the imported module inside a warning context manager provided by PyTest's `pytest.warns()` decorator, which catches SAWarnings raised by SQLAlchemy and converts them into informative error messages displayed at the end of the tests.
- Executes the main function of the imported module while capturing any warnings generated by SQLAlchemy.
- Asserts that the captured print statements match the expected ones stored in the `expected_calls` list defined elsewhere in the test suite.
