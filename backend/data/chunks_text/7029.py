- This function `read_user_me()` takes a parameter `user`, which is an instance of the `models.User` class, and sets its default value to be obtained using the `Depends()` decorator with the `get_current_active_user()` method from the `deps` module. - The purpose of this function is to provide a convenient way to access the currently authenticated user in other functions or endpoints without having to pass it as a parameter every time. - By returning the retrieved `user` object, we can use this function's result wherever we need the current user's information, such as for authorization checks or personalized data retrieval.
