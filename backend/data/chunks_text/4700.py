- This function tests the `POST /files/` endpoint by uploading a file using the `TestClient`.
- The temporary directory (`tmp_path`) is used to store the file being uploaded.
- The file's contents are written to disk and then opened in binary mode for sending to the server.
- A successful response from the server is expected with a JSON body containing the size of the uploaded file.
