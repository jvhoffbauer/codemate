- This function handles a POST request to the `/token` endpoint and returns an OAuth 2.0 access token in response. - The `Annotated` decorator is used to validate the incoming request body using Pydantic's `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm`. - If the provided credentials are valid (i.e., the user exists and their password matches), an access token with an expiration time of `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` minutes is created using FastAPI's built-in `create_access_token()` function. - The resulting dictionary containing the access token and its type ("bearer") is returned as JSON.
