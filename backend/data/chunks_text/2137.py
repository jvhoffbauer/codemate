- Defines a function `get_path_param_ge` that takes an optional argument `item_id`, which is also used as a path parameter with default value of `Path('ge', ge=3)`. - Returns the value of `item_id` after converting it to a `Path` object, where 'ge' represents a query string parameter for filtering items by their geometric extent (e.g., minimum and maximum coordinates). This allows users to easily retrieve specific items based on their spatial properties without having to pass multiple arguments separately.
