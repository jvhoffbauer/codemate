- This function takes a sequence of BaseRoutes as input and returns a list of ModelFields representing all fields that should be included in the OpenAPI schema generated by FastAPI's documentation feature. - It separates the fields into four categories based on their location within the API endpoint: body (request data), response (returned values), query parameters (URL arguments), and headers/cookies passed to callback functions. - For each category, it iteratively adds any relevant fields from each Route object encountered during traversal of the dependency graph. - The resulting list is flattened and returned as a single list of ModelFields.
