- This method is an asynchronous function that handles HTTP requests and responses in Starlette framework. - It takes three arguments `scope`, `receive`, and `send`. - The first line checks for a variable called `root_path` which might be set by the user to specify a base URL path. If found, it adds this value to the `scope` dictionary for further use within the application. - Afterwards, it calls the parent class's implementation of `__call__()` with updated `scope` dictionary.
