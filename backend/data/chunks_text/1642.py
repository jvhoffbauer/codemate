- Defines an asynchronous function `dependency_c` that takes a keyword argument `dep_b`, which is passed to the `Dependency` decorator from another module called `dependency_b`. This allows us to inject dependencies into this function dynamically at runtime, without having to pass them in explicitly. - Inside the function body, we generate a new object `dep_c` and attempt to yield it using the `yield` statement. However, before returning control back to the caller, we close the resource associated with `dep_b` (presumably some kind of database connection or network socket). By doing so, we ensure that all resources are properly cleaned up when the function completes execution, regardless of whether an exception was raised during its execution. Note that since `yield` expressions return values lazily, any cleanup logic should be executed synchronously within a `finally` block instead of inside the generator expression itself.
