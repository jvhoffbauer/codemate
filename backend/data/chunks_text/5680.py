- Defines a function `remove_global` with optional arguments `name` (str) and `alias` (str). If both are none, clears entire globals dictionary; otherwise removes specific variables based on either their names or aliases. - Uses list comprehension to iterate over keys of `__globals__`, which contains all global variables, and checks whether they match specified criteria using tuple unpacking syntax. - Removes matching items from `__globals__` using `pop`. The last argument specifies that it should return `None` instead of raising an exception when trying to delete non-existent keys.
