- This function is a validator for the `POSTGRES_URI` field in a configuration class using Pydantic's `@validator` decorator with the `pre=True` flag to run it before other validation functions. - It takes two arguments: the value of the `POSTGRES_URI` field (if present), and the entire dictionary of configuration values. - If the URI string is already provided, it returns it as is. Otherwise, it constructs a new URI string by combining various configuration fields, including the database schema ("postgresql+asyncpg"), username, password (retrieved from another configuration field called "POSTGRES_PASSWORD" using Pydantic's `SecretStr` type to store sensitive data securely), hostname, and database name.
