- Defines a `UserCrud` object with customized `create_fields`, which is registered as a CRUD for SQLAlchemy and included in the FastAPI application's routers. - Asserts that the expected fields are present in the schema created by the CRUD (i.e., `username`) while an unexpected field (i.e., `password`) is absent. - Tests the API endpoints to ensure that the correct fields are being passed through during creation, where the `password` field is ignored due to it not being specified in the `create_fields`.
