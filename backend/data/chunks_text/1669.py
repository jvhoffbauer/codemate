- Defines a GET request endpoint for retrieving users (`"/users/"`) using FastAPI's `@app.get()` decorator. - Accepts an argument named `commons`, which is annotated with both `Annotated` and `Depends`. This allows us to pass in a dictionary of common parameters that can be used across multiple endpoints without having to repeat them. - Returns the value passed into `commons` as the response body.
