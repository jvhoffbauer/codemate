- Tests whether `Cookie.__repr__()` and `Cookie.__str__()` methods return expected values for a cookie with value 'teststr'
- Uses Python's built-in unittest module to write an automated test case
- Asserts that the string representation of the Cookie object is equal to its class name followed by parentheses containing the cookie value, which helps in debugging and understanding the state of objects during testing
