- Defines a `test_read_fields` function that takes an instance of `FastAPI`, `AsyncClient`, and two fixtures (`fake_articles` and `models`) as arguments.
- Creates a custom SQLAlchemy CRUD object called `ArticleCrud` with a specific prefix for its API routes ("/article").
- Specifies which fields should be included when reading records using the `read_fields` attribute. In this case, it excludes the primary key field ("id"), but includes "title", "description", "category", and "user". Note that "category" and "user" are excluded because they're relationships between articles and categories or users respectively.
- Registers the new CRUD object to the main application by including its router.
- Asserts that the expected fields are present in the schema returned by the CRUD object.
- Makes a GET request to retrieve a single article item from the API, and checks that the response contains the correct data without the primary key field.
