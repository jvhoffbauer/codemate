- Defines a `User` model with two fields, both using Amis components for forms and filters. One of them also has an audio table column. - Uses the `model_fields()` function to extract information about the fields' configurations. - Converts each configuration into its corresponding Amis component (form item or filter item). - Asserts that the resulting components have expected properties based on their original configurations in the model.
