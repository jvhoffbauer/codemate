- This function checks whether a Couchbase user with the given `new_user_id` already exists in the specified `cluster_url`. If the user doesn't exist, it creates the user using the provided credentials (`username`, `password`, and `new_user_password`) for both creating and authenticating. - The function returns `True` if the user already exists to indicate that no further action is required. Otherwise, it calls another helper function called `create_couchbase_user()` to actually perform the creation of the new user.
