- Attempts to create a `Hero` model with a column that references a non-existent `Team` primary key (i.e., `team_id`) without specifying it as a foreign key using SQLAlchemy's `ForeignKey` or `foreign_keys` decorator. - Raises a `RuntimeError` due to an inconsistency in the database schema between the ORM and SQLAlchemy layers. This is because SQLAlchemy requires all columns referencing other tables to be defined as foreign keys, while FastAPI's Pydantic models allow for more flexible data validation. By raising this error, we ensure consistency between these two layers and prevent potential issues down the line.
