- This method retrieves the page schema for a specific web page using the `super()` function to call its parent's implementation of `get_page_schema()`. If the result is not null, it checks whether the `src` attribute is set in the current object (i.e., this instance). If so, it creates an `Iframe` object with that URL as its source and assigns it to either the existing `iframe` variable or a new one. It then verifies whether the site's settings include a base URL; if they do, it updates the `url` field of the page schema accordingly. Otherwise, it removes any scheme prefix from the URL before setting it. Finally, it sets the `schema_` property of the page schema to the created `iframe` object. - The purpose of this method seems to be extracting relevant information about a given web page, such as its URL and content structure, which can later be used by other parts of the application. By creating an `Iframe` object representing the page, we can access its HTML and CSS properties without actually loading them into memory. Additionally, by checking the site's settings, we can ensure that relative links are resolved correctly regardless of where the page appears on the site.
