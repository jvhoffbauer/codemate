- This function, named `get_mkdocs_material_langs`, is decorated with a decorator called `@lru_cache`. This means that it will cache its result to improve performance when called multiple times with the same arguments. - The function returns a list of strings (`List[str]`) containing the names of languages supported by MkDocs Material, which are stored as HTML files inside a directory called 'languages' located within the 'partials' subdirectory of the 'templates' folder of the MkDocs Material package. - To retrieve this information, the function first gets the path of the current module ('material') and then navigates up one level to find the parent directory where the 'templates', 'partials', and 'languages' directories reside. It then uses Python's glob function to iterate over all the HTML files found in the 'languages' directory and extract their stem (i.e., filename without extension) using the `Path` class from the standard library's `pathlib` module.
