- Defines a GET endpoint for querying examples using FastAPI's `@app.get()` decorator
- Uses Pydantic's `Union` and `Query` to define an optional string parameter called `data`, with default value of `None`. The `examples` attribute is used to provide example values that can be selected by the user when making requests (in this case, "json_schema_query1" and "json_schema_query2"). - Provides OpenAPI documentation for the `data` parameter through the use of the `openapi_examples` dictionary, which allows users to select from predefined queries ("Query One" and "Query Two") along with their corresponding descriptions and summaries.
