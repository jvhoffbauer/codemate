- Imports a Flask application and its corresponding `client` object for testing purposes.
- Sets the dependency overrides to none, which means that all dependencies will be resolved normally during this test case.
- Makes an HTTP GET request with query parameters 'q','skip' and 'limit'.
- Asserts that the status code of the response is 200 (OK) and saves the text content in a variable named'responseText'.
- Extracts the JSON data from the response body and asserts that it contains expected keys ('message' and 'params') with their respective values ('Hello Items!' and dictionary containing query params).
