- Defines an asynchronous function `get()` with a single parameter `foo`, which is annotated with three decorators: `Annotated`, `Query(min_length=1)`, and `Query()`. - The `Annotated` decorator combines multiple field-level validations into a single annotation for use in Pydantic models or FastAPI routes. In this case, it's used to validate that `foo` is both an integer (via `int`) and has a minimum length of 1 (via `Query(min_length=1)`). - The `Query()` decorator specifies that the value of `foo` will be obtained from a query parameter named "foo" when making requests to this endpoint using FastAPI's built-in routing system. If no such parameter exists, a `HTTPException` will be raised with status code 400 ("Bad Request").
