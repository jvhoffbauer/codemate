- Defines a method `filter_modelfield()` that filters a list of SQLAlchemy model fields based on certain criteria.
- Accepts an iterable of fields as input, along with options to specify which types of fields should be included (`save_class`) and which ones should be excluded (`exclude`).
- Filters out any non-model fields using another helper function called `filter_insfield()`.
- Creates a new list containing clones of each filtered model field using the `clone()` method provided by SQLAlchemy's `InstrumentedAttribute` class.
- Removes any None values or excluded fields from the resulting list.
