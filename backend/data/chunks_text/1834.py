- Defines an asynchronous function called `websocket_endpoint` that takes several arguments including a WebSocket object and various dependencies such as an item ID, optional query parameter, session information, etc. - Establishes a connection with the client by calling `await websocket.accept()`. - Continuously receives messages from the client using `await websocket.receive_text()`, processes them, and sends responses back to the client via `await websocket.send_text()`. - Includes conditional statements based on certain parameters being passed in (such as the presence of a specific query parameter).
