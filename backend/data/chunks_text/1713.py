- This function is a GET request handler for the `/items/{item_id}` endpoint.
- It takes two arguments, `item_id` and `q`, which are decorated with Pydantic's `Path` and `Query` classes respectively.
- The `item_id` argument is required (as indicated by the asterisk) and has a default value provided by the `Path` decorator that sets its title to "The ID of the item to get".
- If the optional `q` query parameter is present in the URL, it will be added as a key-value pair to the dictionary returned by this function.
