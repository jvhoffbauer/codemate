- This function tests a GET request to retrieve an item with ID 3 using Flask's built-in `client` object. - The expected HTTP status code is set to 418 (IETF Error for 'Calling Bird'), which is not a standard error code but used here as a joke. - If the actual status code returned by the server differs from the expected one or if there are any issues parsing the JSON response body, an AssertionError will be raised.
