- Defines a property called `route_read` that returns a callable function (a coroutine).
- The returned function is an asynchronous view function for handling HTTP GET requests to retrieve one or more items identified by their IDs.
- Before returning the requested items, it checks whether the user has read permission using the `has_read_permission()` method and raises an error response if necessary.
