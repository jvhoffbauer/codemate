- Defines a function called `response_model_list_of_model_no_annotation` that returns a list of two instances of the `DBUser` model without any annotations or decorators related to API responses. - Each instance in the list has attributes for `name`, `surname`, and `password_hash`. - This implementation is useful when you want to manually create a list of objects to be returned as a response, but don't need the convenience provided by Pydantic's automatic JSON serialization features.
