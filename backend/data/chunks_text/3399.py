- Tests that passing a path parameter of '0' for an item ID with minimum value set to '-1' raises a validation error with status code 422 and detailed message about input being less than zero. - The error message conforms to JSON API specification format as defined by pydantic-jsonschema. - This test case also includes a fallback implementation for older versions of pydantic (v1) where the error message follows a different format, which will eventually be removed in future releases.
