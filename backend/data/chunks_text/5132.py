- This function is called when a request is made to the server using Starlette's ASGI protocol. - It checks whether the requested resource type is HTTP or not. If it's not an HTTP request, it passes control to the main application handler `self.app`. - If it's an HTTP request, it defines a wrapper around the `send()` method that adds cache headers based on certain conditions. The wrapper sends the modified messages instead of sending directly from the original `send()` method.
