- Asserts that the status code is 200 and the returned JSON matches the expected structure with specific keys such as 'openapi', 'info', 'paths', 'components'.
- Describes the GET request to retrieve items ('/items') including its responses (success or validation error), summary, operation ID, parameters, and headers.
