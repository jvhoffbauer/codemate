- Defines an asynchronous function `get_shared_counter()` that takes a default argument'shared' of type string, which is passed to the decorator `Header`. This decorator adds a header with the given name to the response. - Inside the function, a global variable `_shared_counter` is incremented and its new value is returned along with the concatenated values of'shared' and '_shared_counter'. The result is yielded using the `yield from` statement in order to return multiple results at once.
