- Generates authentication headers for a test user with email `settings.EMAIL_TEST_USER` using the `get_auth_header_from_email()` function and returns them as a dictionary. - The `normal_user_token_headers()` function is used to provide authentication credentials for making requests on behalf of a regular (non-admin) user during testing. - This function can be called within tests that require authorization as an ordinary user to ensure accurate results.
