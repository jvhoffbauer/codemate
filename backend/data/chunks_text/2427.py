- This endpoint uses a dependency function `asyncgen_state_try` to set an initial value for the `state` parameter, which is an asynchronous generator that raises an exception after yielding a specific string. - The `get_sync_async_raise` function takes the `state` parameter and checks if it matches the expected value. If so, it raises an `AsyncDependencyError`, which is a custom error raised by FastAPI's built-in dependency resolver when an async dependency fails during resolution. By raising this error in our own code, we can simulate an async dependency failure and test how FastAPI handles it.
