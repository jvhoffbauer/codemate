- Defines a class method called `__modify_schema__` that takes in a dictionary representing a field schema as an argument (named `field_schema`) and returns none. - Inside this method, updates the `type` and `format` keys of the provided `field_schema` dictionary with new values ("string" and "binary", respectively). This is likely being used to modify or customize how a specific field within a larger data structure should be handled by some external library or framework. By modifying these properties at the schema level, it allows for more consistent and predictable behavior when working with this type of data.
