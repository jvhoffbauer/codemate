- This endpoint uses FastAPI's dependency injection system to pass a generated asynchronous function (returned by `methods_dependency.asynchronous_gen`) as an argument to the endpoint handler using the `Depends()` decorator. - The returned value of this asynchronous function is then passed back to the client in response to their request. - By generating dependencies at runtime, we can avoid hardcoding them into our endpoints and make it easier to test and maintain our application over time.
