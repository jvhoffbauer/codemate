- Defines a DELETE request handler for deleting a specific hero by ID using FastAPI's decorator syntax and dependency injection mechanism to retrieve an SQLAlchemy database connection from the `engine`. - Retrieves the requested hero object from the database using its primary key (ID). If it doesn't exist, raises a customized HTTP exception with status code 404 and error message "Hero not found". - Deletes the retrieved hero object from the database session and commits the changes. Returns a simple JSON response indicating success ("OK" flag set to true).
