- This function tests that an item with no Content-Type header is still parsed as JSON by FastAPI's default JSON parser. - It sends a POST request to the `/items/` endpoint without specifying a Content-Type header and passes the JSON data directly in the body of the request. - The function checks that the server returns a 200 status code and parses the response as JSON, verifying that the expected fields are present (with some missing due to lack of corresponding input).
