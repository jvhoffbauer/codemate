- Defines a `test_read_fields_relationship` function that tests reading fields and relationships using SqlalchemyCrud from FastAPI's SQLAlchemy integration.
- Creates an instance of `ArticleCrud`, which is a wrapper around the `Article` model with customized behavior for CRUD operations.
- Registers the crud instance as a router to include it in the FastAPI application.
- Tests the schema generated by `ArticleCrud` to ensure that unwanted fields are excluded (e.g., ID field).
- Makes a GET request to retrieve a specific article item and checks that the response includes the expected relationship data (i.e., category and tags).
