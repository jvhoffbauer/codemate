- This function `handle_req` handles incoming HTTP requests using FastAPI's routing system. It takes several arguments including an instance of `Request`, which represents the request being made by the client, as well as other contextual information such as dependencies and error handling mechanisms. - The function creates a shadow copy of the original request (`RequestShadow`) to preserve its state during processing. This allows us to modify certain aspects of the request without affecting the original one. - The function iterates over each defined route (`MethodRoute`) and checks whether the current request matches that route's pattern. If there is a full match, then the corresponding handler method is called with the modified request object and any necessary parameters passed through. - If no matching route is found, a `MethodNotFound` exception is raised indicating that the requested endpoint was not found.
