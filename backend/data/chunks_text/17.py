- This method overrides the built-in `__setattr__()` of Python classes to provide custom attribute setting behavior for specific types of classes (i.e., those that inherit from SQLAlchemy's `DeclarativeBase`). - It first checks whether the class being modified is a table model using the helper function `is_table_model_class()`. If so, it calls the equivalent method on the base class `DeclarativeMeta`, which performs additional setup required by SQLAlchemy's declarative system. - Otherwise, it simply delegates the attribute assignment to the parent class's implementation of `__setattr__()`.
