- Generates an OpenAPI (Swagger) JSON schema for a FastAPI application using `fastapi generate --openapi`.
- The generated schema is stored in the file `openapi.json`, which can be used to document and share the API's endpoints and parameters with other developers or tools.
- The schema includes information about each endpoint's HTTP method, URL path, request and response formats, error handling, and documentation.
- It also defines custom schemas for validation errors that are specific to FastAPI's usage of Pydantic models.
