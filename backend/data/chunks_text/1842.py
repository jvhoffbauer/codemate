- This function handles a POST request to the `/files/` endpoint using FastAPI's decorator syntax (@app.post).
- It accepts two arguments annotated with Pydantic's File class (file and fileb) representing binary data from HTTP requests. The first argument is assigned directly to the variable 'file', while the second one is stored in a context manager called UploadFile.
- Additionally, it takes a string parameter named 'token' passed through the form data of the request via the Form() annotation.
- Finally, the function returns a dictionary containing three key-value pairs that represent different attributes of the received files and tokens.
