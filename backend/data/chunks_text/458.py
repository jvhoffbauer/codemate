- This test case uses `unittest.mock.patch` to replace the built-in print function and capture its output using a custom testing print function provided by SQLModel's `get_testing_print_function`.
- The `test_tutorial` function imports the module `docs_src.tutorial.where.tutorial004_py310`, which is part of SQLModel's documentation examples, and executes its main function while capturing the output printed by `print` statements inside the module.
- The captured outputs are compared against expected values stored in variables named `expected_calls`, which contain lists representing the arguments passed to each `print` statement. If all expected outputs match the actual ones, the test passes; otherwise, an error message is raised indicating which expected value did not appear in the output.
