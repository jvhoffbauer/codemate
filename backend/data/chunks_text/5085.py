- Defines a new product attribute called "Release date" with a slug of `release-date`, an input type of DATE, and various other settings that make it searchable and displayable in different contexts. - Adds two values to this attribute using the `AttributeValue` model, which are stored as both a human-readable name and a machine-friendly slug/ID. - Commits these changes to the database using the `AsyncDAL` ORM.
