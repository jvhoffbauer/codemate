- Defines a fixture `ep` that wraps an existing endpoint (represented by the `ep` parameter) and adds two new methods to it, called `probe1` and `probe2`. Both methods take a list of `Balance` objects as input and return the same list unmodified. The purpose of these probes is likely for testing or debugging purposes. - Uses PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator to create a reusable test resource that can be used in multiple tests. In this case, the fixture returns the modified endpoint object after adding the two new methods. This allows other tests to easily access the updated endpoint with the added functionality without having to define it again each time.
