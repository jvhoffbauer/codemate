- Defines a decorator function `choices` that takes a class as an argument
- Adds two lists to a new list called 'empty' and assigns it back to the variable 'empty'. The first list is created conditionally based on whether the given class has a method named `__empty__`. If so, it adds a tuple containing None and the value of this method. This allows us to specify an "empty" option for select fields using Django forms. - Loops through all members (i.e., attributes with values) of the given class and creates tuples consisting of their values and labels. These are added to the 'empty' list. - Returns the concatenated list of both 'empty' and the newly generated list.
