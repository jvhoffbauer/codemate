- This function is called `recover_password`, and it takes an email address as a parameter (`email`) and returns any value using FastAPI's `Any` type hint. It also accepts a database session from the dependency injection mechanism provided by SQLAlchemy's `Session`. - The function retrieves the user associated with the given email address using the CRUD operations defined earlier. If the user doesn't exist, it raises a customized HTTP exception with a specific error message. - After finding the user, the function generates a new password reset token for that user using the `generate_password_reset_token()` helper function. - Finally, the function sends an email to the user's registered email address containing the generated password reset link using the `send_reset_password_email()` helper function. The email contains both the original email address and the newly generated password reset token.
