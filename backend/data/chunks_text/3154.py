- Tests overriding Flask's default behavior of raising server errors by setting `raise_server_exceptions` to False in a test client instance. - Makes an HTTP GET request to the "/server-error" endpoint using the test client and asserts that it returns a status code of 500 (internal server error). - Verifies that the JSON response contains a key named "exception" with a value of "server-error".
