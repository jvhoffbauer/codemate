- This is a decorator function that takes a class (cls) and a value (v) as arguments. - It's marked with `pragma: no cover`, which means it won't be executed during testing to avoid false positives in test coverage reports. - The implementation of this decorator simply returns the input value without modification (i.e., it doesn't perform any validation).
