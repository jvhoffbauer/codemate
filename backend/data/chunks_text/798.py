- Defines an asynchronous function `create_user` that takes a `AuthUser` object as input and returns either a dictionary or `None`. - Inside the function, creates an SQLAlchemy INSERT statement with values for email, hashed password, and current timestamp. - Returns the result of executing the query using `fetch_one()`, which is expected to be a single row containing the newly created user data.
