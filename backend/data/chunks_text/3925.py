- Sends a GET request to `/items/` with multiple query parameters (`q=foo` and `q=bar`) using Pytest's built-in `TestClient`.
- Asserts that the server returns an HTTP status code of 200 and stores the response text for debugging purposes.
- Parses the JSON response body and asserts that it contains an array containing both query values ("foo" and "bar").
