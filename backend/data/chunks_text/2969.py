- This endpoint uses a dependency function `methods_dependency.synchronous` to provide a synchronous method that returns a string value, which is then passed as an argument to the endpoint's response. - The `Depends()` decorator is used to inject the dependency into the endpoint parameter list. - The `async` keyword before the function name indicates that this is an async function, but it doesn't actually contain any asynchronous operations and will be executed synchronously due to the use of the `synchronous` method from the dependency function.
