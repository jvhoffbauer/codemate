- Defines a function named `pg_to_es` that converts data from PostgreSQL to Elasticsearch format.
- Takes no arguments and returns nothing (i.e., it's a void function).

2) How would you explain the purpose of this block of code in your own words?:

```python
try:
    # some code here
except Exception as e:
    print("Error:", str(e))
finally:
    # some cleanup code here
```

In plain English, this block of code tries to execute some code inside the try block. If an error occurs while executing that code, the program jumps directly to the except block where we can handle the exception by printing out an error message using the `print()` statement. After handling the exception, the program continues with any remaining statements in the finally block, regardless of whether or not there was an exception. The finally block is used for performing clean up operations like closing files, releasing locks etc. That should be executed irrespective of whether an exception occurred or not.
