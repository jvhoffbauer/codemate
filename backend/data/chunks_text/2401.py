- Defines a function `generator_state_try` that takes an optional argument `state`, which is obtained using the `Depends` decorator and passed to the `get_state` function. - Inside the function, it sets the value of the key `'/sync_raise'` in the dictionary `state` to a string representing the start of the generator raise operation. - The function then enters a `yield` statement, which suspends its execution until another part of the program resumes it (in this case, by calling one of the FastAPI endpoints). - If a `SyncDependencyError` occurs during the suspension, the error is caught and added to a list called `errors`. - After the `yield` statement completes or an exception is thrown, the function cleans up any resources used during the operation by setting the value of the same key back to a different string representing the finalization of the generator raise operation.
