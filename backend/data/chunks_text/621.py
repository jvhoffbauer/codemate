- Imports `test_tutorial002` function and `create_engine` function from SQLAlchemy library, and imports `expected_calls` list from an unknown location (assumed to be a fixture or constant). - Sets up variables for SQLite database connection URL and engine object using `sqlite_url` variable and `create_engine` function respectively. - Creates a mock print function called `new_print`, which captures all printed statements during execution of `mod.main()`. - Patches the built-in `print` function with the newly created mock function. - Executes `mod.main()` inside the patched context. - Asserts that the captured output matches the expected output stored in `expected_calls`.
