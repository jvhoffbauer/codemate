- Defines a route to return a FastUUID object as JSON.
- Creates a custom Pydantic model with a MyUUID field and defines a serializer function for it using `@field_serializer`.
- Defines another route to return an instance of the custom Pydantic model.
- Uses PyTest's built-in testing framework to test both routes and ensure they return expected results in JSON format.
