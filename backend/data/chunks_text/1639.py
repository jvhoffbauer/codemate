- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()` that takes a dependency of type `Annotated[CommonQueryParams, Depends()]`. This is used to pass query parameters from the URL into the function. - Initializes an empty dictionary called `response`. - Checks if the `q` parameter (a search term) is present in the query params and adds it to the `response` dictionary. - Retrieves a list of items from a mock database called `fake_items_db`, slicing it based on the values passed through the `Commons` object's `skip` and `limit` attributes. - Adds the retrieved items to the `response` dictionary. - Returns the final `response` dictionary.
