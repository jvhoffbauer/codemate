- Uses FastAPI's dependency injection system to pass common parameters (likely authentication or authorization information) to a decorated function using the `Depends()` decorator. - The decorated function, `decorator_depends()`, returns a dictionary with a key of 'in' and a value of 'decorator-depends'. This could be used as part of an API response.
