- This function is an asynchronous view that returns a JSON response containing the OpenAPI specification for the current FastAPI application. - It takes a `Request` object as input and retrieves the path of the current request from its scope using the key 'root_path'. - If this path is not already present in the list of URLs where the API can be accessed (stored in `server_urls`), it checks whether the path should be added to the beginning of the list of servers (as specified by the `root_path_in_servers` attribute). - The function then calls the internal `openapi()` method of the FastAPI instance and returns its result wrapped in a JSON response.
