1. This function takes several arguments including a request object, matrix set ID, input file path, output format (optional), zoom level scale (optional), minimum and maximum zoom levels (optional), parameters related to layers, datasets, pixel selection, buffering, post-processing, rescaling, color formulas, colormaps, rendering options, and environment variables.
2. The function generates a TileJSON document that returns information about the bounds, center point, minimum and maximum zoom levels, URL for accessing tiles at different scales, and any other relevant parameters based on user inputs.
3. The generated TileJSON document can then be used by web mapping applications like Leaflet or OpenLayers to display geospatial data from COG files using various styles and formats.
