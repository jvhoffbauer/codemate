- Defines a function `no_response_model_annotation_return_invalid_model` that returns an instance of the `Item` class instead of the expected `User` type, causing an error during deserialization due to incorrect model annotation in the API response schema. - The returned object is not compatible with the expected `User` type, leading to an invalid model exception during deserialization by FastAPI's built-in JSON parser or other similar libraries used for handling requests and responses.
