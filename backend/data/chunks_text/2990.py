- Generates an OpenAPI schema for a FastAPI application using `client.get("/openapi.json")`.
- The generated JSON schema conforms to version 3.1.0 of the OpenAPI specification.
- Includes definitions for request and response bodies, as well as error responses, using the `RequestBody`, `Responses`, and `Schema` attributes in the FastAPI decorators.
- Defines custom schemas for complex data types (e.g., nested dictionaries) using PyYAML's `IsDict` type hinting function.
- Uses Pydantic's `BaseModel` class to generate schema definitions automatically from Python classes.
- Provides detailed documentation for each endpoint through the use of descriptive variable names and comments within the FastAPI functions.
