- Endpoint `GET /no-alias/list` returns a list of objects with the `ModelNoAlias` type, defined elsewhere in the application. - The returned list contains two dictionaries, each representing an object with a single key-value pair ("name": "Foo") or ("name": "Bar"). - There is no aliasing (i.e., renaming) of keys between requests and responses using Pydantic's built-in features; this can be useful for consistency and simplicity in APIs that handle complex data structures.
