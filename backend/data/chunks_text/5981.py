- Tests if `annotation_outer_type()` function correctly identifies the outer type of a Union annotation with scalar types (int and str) as its elements. - Asserts that the outer type of `Union[int, str]` is `int`. This means that in this specific case, the function would return `int`, since it's the first element listed in the union.
