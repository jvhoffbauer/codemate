- This function defines an endpoint for retrieving a user with the given ID using FastAPI's `@app.get()` decorator. - The path parameter `{user_id}` is bound to the `int` type and passed as an argument to the function. - The `response_model` attribute specifies that the returned value should be serialized according to the `User` schema defined in `schemas`. - The `dependencies` list includes a call to the `get_db()` function, which likely returns a database connection or session object used by other functions in this module. - Inside the function body, the `crud.get_user()` method from some custom CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations module is called with the provided `user_id`, returning the corresponding `User` instance. - If the result of `crud.get_user()` is `None`, a `HTTPException` with status code 404 ("Not Found") and error message "User not found" is raised instead.
