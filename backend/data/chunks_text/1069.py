- This function takes in three arguments: `settings`, `discussion_id`, and `body`. It returns a new comment object created by executing an addDiscussionComment mutation using GraphQL. - The `get_graphql_response()` helper function is used to execute the mutation with provided parameters and return the resulting JSON response. - The returned value from this function is parsed into a Python class (AddCommentResponse) that represents the structure of the expected response from the server. - Finally, the desired information (the newly created comment) is extracted from the response and returned as the result of the `create_comment()` function call.
