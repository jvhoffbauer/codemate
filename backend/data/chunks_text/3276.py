- Defines a `ModelWithDatetimeField` subclass of Pydantic's `BaseModel`, which includes a `datatime` field annotated as a Python `datetime`. - Implements a custom serialization method for the `datatime` field using Pydantic's `@field_serializer` decorator. This method converts the datetime to UTC time zone and removes microseconds before formatting it as ISO string. - Creates a FastAPI application instance and registers a route that returns an instance of `ModelWithDatetimeField`. - Uses Pytest's built-in `TestClient` fixture to make HTTP requests against the FastAPI server and tests whether the expected JSON output is returned in response to GET request on the registered endpoint.
