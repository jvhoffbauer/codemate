- Defines a method `get_action()` that takes in a `Request` object and optional keyword arguments (`**kwargs`) as input. - Checks whether an attribute called `getter` is defined on the current instance of this class. If it's not, returns the default value stored in another attribute called `action`. - Otherwise, calls the `getter()` function with the given `Request` object and any additional keyword arguments passed to `get_action()`, and assigns its result to a variable named `action`. - Uses Python's built-in `asyncio.iscoroutine()` function to check whether `action` is an asynchronous coroutine or not. If so, waits for it to complete using `await` before returning its final value. - Finally, returns the resulting `Action` object.
