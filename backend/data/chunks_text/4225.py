- This function tests a normal application request with specific query parameters and pagination settings using Flask's built-in testing client. - The `dependency_overrides` attribute is set to `None`, indicating that all dependencies should be resolved normally during this request. - The GET request is made for items with filtering criteria of 'foo', skipping the first 100 results, and limiting the result set to 200 items. - The status code and JSON response body are checked against expected values.
