- Defines a property named `route_delete` that returns a callable function with no arguments and any return type (represented by 'Any'). - Throws an exception ('NotImplementedError') if this method is called, indicating that it should be implemented in subclasses of this class. This could potentially be used as part of a base class for defining RESTful API endpoints or routes. The `@property` decorator allows us to access the returned value as if it were an attribute of the object, rather than having to explicitly call a separate method. By raising an error when implementing this method, we can ensure that all required methods are defined before using these objects in our application.
