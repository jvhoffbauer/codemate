- Defines a `EndpointFactory` subclass of `BaseTilerFactory`, which is used to create and manage RESTful API endpoints in FastAPI.
- Implements the `register_routes()` method, which registers two endpoint routes with different URL patterns using FastAPI's decorator syntax.
- The first route (`/<param2>.json`) takes query parameters `param1` and `param2`, returns JSON response containing the URL generated by calling `url_for()` from another function or view.
- The second route (`/<param2>`) also accepts query parameters `param1` and `param2`, but simply returns an object containing the value of `param2`.
