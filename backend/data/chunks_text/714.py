- Tests a custom transformer middleware by creating an instance of `AsyncClient` from `transformer_app`, which includes the middleware in its application stack. - Makes a GET request to the "test" endpoint and sets the X-Request-ID header to the value generated by `uuid4()`. - Asserts that the X-Request-ID header returned in the response is twice the original value set in the request header.
