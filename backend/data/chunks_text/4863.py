- This function is called `login`, and it takes a form containing a username and password as input using FastAPI's dependency injection system (`Depends`) with the `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm`. - The function retrieves the default database connection from the application context using `get_default_database()`. - It authenticates the user by calling the `crud.user.authenticate()` method of the SQLAlchemy ORM extension `motor` with the provided credentials. If authentication fails, it raises a `HTTPException` with status code 400 ("Bad Request"). - If the authenticated user is inactive, another `HTTPException` with status code 400 ("Bad Request") is raised. - An access token is created using the `create_access_token()` function from FastAPI's security module, passing the user's username as data and setting its expiration time to the value configured in `config.ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`. - Finally, the response object contains both the generated access token and the required bearer token type.
