- This function is an asynchronous method that returns a `App` object representing a FastAPI application with customized branding and layout elements for displaying pages generated by Amis.
- It sets the application name, logo, header, footer, asideBefore, and asideAfter sections using templates and HTML strings. The header includes a link to the GitHub repository of fastapi-amis-admin, while the footer displays copyright information and links to the project website and version number.
- The `get_page_schema_children` method is called to retrieve the child components of the current page being requested, which are then added to the main page array in the `pages` section of the returned `App`. If no child components exist, an empty list is used instead.
