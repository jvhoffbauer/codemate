- This method is called when a dictionary representation of an object is needed, such as in `print(obj)`.
- It raises an error because this class doesn't have a meaningful dictionary representation and should not be used to create dictionaries from instances of it.
- The purpose of this method is to prevent accidental misuse or unexpected behavior by raising an exception instead of returning an incorrect result.
