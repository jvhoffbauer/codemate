- This function tests the `GET /items/` endpoint using Flask's built-in testing client (client). - It asserts that the status code of the response is 200 and saves it in a variable called'response'. - If the status code is not 200, an error message containing the text from the response body is printed instead. - The JSON data returned by the server is compared to a list of expected values using Python's built-in json module. - In this case, we expect two items with specific names and prices.
