- This function tests a specific tutorial (tutorial002 in many_to_many folder of tutorial directory) using pytest's `clear_sqlmodel` fixture to clear SQLModel's metadata before each test case. - It imports the module containing the tutorial and sets its database URL and engine, then creates a mock print function called `new_print` that captures all printed statements during execution. - The original built-in `print` is replaced by this mock function using Python's `patch` decorator, allowing us to capture any output generated by the tutorial without actually printing it to the console. - Finally, we call the main method of the tutorial module and check if the captured outputs match our expectations using an `assert`.
