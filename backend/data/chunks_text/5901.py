- This function takes a `Type[BaseModel]` as input, which is a Pydantic model class, and returns a dictionary containing the names and labels of its fields.
- The function allows customization through several optional arguments:
  - `prefix` adds a string to the beginning of each label.
  - `exclude_required` excludes required fields from the output.
  - `exclude` and `include` allow filtering by specific field names. If `__all__` is included in either list, all fields are returned/filtered respectively.
