- Defines a GET request for an item with ID `item_id`, returning either a PlaneItem or a CarItem based on the value of `item_id`. - The returned object is type-annotated using Pydantic's `response_model` decorator to ensure consistent JSON output format. - The dictionary `items` containing all available items is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the application.
