- This function tests a specific tutorial (many_to_many in this case) by running its main method and checking that certain print statements are called using pytest's `get_testing_print_function`. - The `create_engine` function is used to connect to an SQLAlchemy database, which is then passed to the module being tested. - A list of expected print statements is stored in the `expected_calls` variable for comparison against the actual output captured during testing.
