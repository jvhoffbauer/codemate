- Defines a nested `_Response` class within another component (not shown here). The name of this inner class is prefixed with an underscore to indicate it's not meant for public use. - Implements Pydantic's `@component_name()` decorator to set the class's name and module attributes. This allows for easier debugging by providing more context in stack traces. - Uses BaseModel as the base class for the response object, which provides basic validation and serialization functionality. - Sets default values for some fields using the `Field()` function from pydantic. These defaults are also provided as examples in JSON schema format using the `json_schema_extra` parameter. - Adds additional configuration options to the class using the `ConfigDict()` function from pydantic. Specifically, we set `extra="forbid"` to disallow any unused keys in JSON input/output, and `json_schema_serialization_defaults_required=True` to ensure that all required fields are included when converting the object to JSON.
