- Defines a function called `no_response_model_annotation_response_class` that returns a Django Rest Framework response object with a content of "Foo". - This function can be used as an alternative to defining a custom response class for situations where there is no model involved and we want to return a simple string or other data type directly in the response body without any additional serialization steps required.
