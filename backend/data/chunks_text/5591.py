- This function creates multiple database records simultaneously using AsyncIOMotor's `async_run_sync()` method to execute a synchronous operation asynchronously. - It takes a list of item objects and converts them into their preprocessed versions by calling `on_create_pre()`. - The resulting list is then passed to an internal helper function called `_create_items()`, which actually performs the insertion operations.
