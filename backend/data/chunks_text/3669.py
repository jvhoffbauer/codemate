- Tests that making a GET request to the root URL without passing any query parameters results in a HTTP status code of 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and an error message indicating that the 'token' parameter is missing. - The error message conforms to the JSON API specification for validation errors. - This test covers the case where Pydantic version 1 is being used, as it includes a fallback error format that will be removed in future versions.
