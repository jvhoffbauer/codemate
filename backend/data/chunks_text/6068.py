- Tests reading user data from a SQLAlchemy database using Pydantic's ORMModelMixin and SqlalchemyCrud classes to generate an API endpoint with a customized response schema (UserRead) that excludes sensitive information like passwords. - Uses Starlette's FastAPI framework for building web applications and its built-in OpenAPI support to automatically document the generated endpoints. - Verifies that the generated documentation accurately reflects the expected behavior of the endpoint by checking the properties of the returned JSON object against the defined schema.
