- Defines a function `requester()` that takes three arguments (`body`, `path_postfix`, and `auth`) to make an HTTP POST request using Flask's built-in client object `app_client`. - The URL for the request is constructed by concatenating the base endpoint (`ep_path`) with the optional `path_postfix`. - If authentication is provided as an argument, it is passed along in the request headers using the `auth` parameter of the `request()` method.
