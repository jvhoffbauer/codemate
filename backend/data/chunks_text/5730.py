- Defines a function called `AnnotatedPage` that returns an instance of FastAPI's `Annotated` class with two arguments: `Page`, which is the type being passed in, and `Depends(self.get_page)`, which specifies that this argument should be obtained using the `get_page()` method defined within the current object (presumably a FastAPI dependency manager). This allows for easier and more concise dependency management when working with FastAPI routes and functions.
