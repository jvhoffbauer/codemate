- Tests synchronous state of generator using Flask's `client` object to simulate a request and verify status codes and responses. - Asserts that initial sync state is 'generator not started'. - Makes GET request to '/sync' endpoint and asserts successful HTTP response (status code 200). - Verifies JSON response from server matches expected value ('generator started'). - Asserts final sync state is 'generator completed'.
