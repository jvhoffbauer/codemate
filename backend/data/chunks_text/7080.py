- Tests creating a new user with an existing username using the `test_create_user_existing_username` function from the `tests/integration/api/v1/users.py` file. - Uses the `random_email()` and `random_lower_string()` functions to generate a unique username (an email address) and password for the new user. - Creates the new user using the `crud.user.create()` function from the `app/core/cruds/user.py` module. - Makes a POST request to the `/users` endpoint of the API with the generated username and password as JSON data, passing the authentication token for the superuser account as headers. - Asserts that the server returns HTTP status code 400 Bad Request, indicating that the request failed due to invalid input. - Verifies that no `_id` field is present in the response body, which indicates that the new user was not actually created by the server.
