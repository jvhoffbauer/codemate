- This is a class method that returns a dictionary representing the state of an object's attributes and their values. - It raises a `NotImplementedError`, indicating that this specific implementation of the `__dict__` property should not be called directly, as it may vary depending on the type of object being represented by the class. - In other words, subclasses can override this method to provide their own customized representation of the object's properties in dictionary form.
