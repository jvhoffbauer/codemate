- Tests the `SubCounterNoCache` view without using Redis cache for storing and retrieving values
- Initializes a global dictionary called `counter_holder` to store the value of the main counter (set to zero)
- Makes two requests to the `SubCounterNoCache` endpoint and asserts that the returned JSON contains the correct values for both the main counter and subcounter
- Does not use Redis cache to retrieve or update any values during these tests
