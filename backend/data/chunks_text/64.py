- Defines a function `set_fields_set()` that takes two arguments: `new_object`, which is an instance or type of SQLModel, and `fields`, which is a set containing FieldInfo objects representing the names of the model's attributes. - Sets the value of the private attribute `__fields_set__` on the given `new_object` to the provided `fields`. This allows for efficient query building by avoiding unnecessary database calls when fetching data from the database based on specific field values.
