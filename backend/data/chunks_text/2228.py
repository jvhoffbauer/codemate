- This function `test_union_scalar_list()` tests if a union of a scalar and a list can be used in FastAPI's Query parameter syntax. - It checks for compatibility with Pydantic version 1 (pv1), which has stricter rules regarding scalar fields versus lists. - The implementation currently disallows using both a scalar and a list in the same Union type, possibly due to limitations or ambiguities in how they are handled by Pydantic/FastAPI.
