- This function tests the `POST /files/` endpoint using a temporary directory to store two sample files. - The `TestClient` from Flask's testing module is used to simulate an HTTP request and retrieve the server's response. - Two files are sent in the request body using the `files` parameter of the `client.post()` method. One file has the name 'test.txt', while the other one has the same name but different contents ('test2.txt'). - The server returns a JSON object containing the sizes (in bytes) of both uploaded files.
