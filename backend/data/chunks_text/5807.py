- This method is called when an instance of this class is used in a `for` loop or with the `list()`, `tuple()`, and `set()` built-in functions to iterate over its child objects (i.e., PageSchemaAdminT instances). - It returns an iterator object that wraps around the `_children` attribute, which contains all the child objects. - The returned iterator conforms to Python's `Iterator` protocol, meaning it can be consumed by various sequence operations like list comprehensions, filtering, mapping, etc.
