- Imports `tutorial003_py310` module from the 'docs_src' package and assigns it to a variable named `mod`.
- Sets the SQLAlchemy connection URL for the `mod` object using the `sqlite_url` attribute.
- Creates an engine instance using the `create_engine()` function of SQLAlchemy, passing in the `sqlite_url` value set earlier.
- Initializes a list called `calls` which will be used later to store print statements made during execution.
- Retrieves a mock version of the builtin `print()` function using the `get_testing_print_function()` utility provided by Pytest. This allows us to capture all print statements made during testing and verify their correctness.
- Assigns this mock `print()` function to the global namespace (i.e., sets its `__builtin__.print` attribute).
- Calls the main function of the `mod` module using the `with` statement to ensure that any resources created inside are automatically cleaned up after the block is exited.
- Asserts that the `calls` list contains exactly the same sequence of strings as those stored in the `expected_calls` constant defined elsewhere in the test suite. If they match, then we can conclude that the output generated by our program matches what was intended.
