- Defines a function called `route` that takes in two arguments: `Request` and `self.AnnotatedPage`. The second argument is annotated with `self`, indicating it's a class attribute. - This function returns the result of calling another function `page_parser` while passing in both `Request` and `self.AnnotatedPage`. - Since this function is marked asynchronous (using `async`) we can assume it will be executed asynchronously by some event loop or scheduler.
