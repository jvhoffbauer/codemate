- Defines a function called `select` with two arguments (`entity_0` and `entity_1`) of types `_TScalar_0` and `_TScalar_1`, respectively. The `type: ignore` annotation is used to suppress mypy's warning about unused type variables. - Returns a new object of type `Select` that takes a tuple as its argument containing both input entities (`(_TScalar_0, _TScalar_1)`). This allows for chaining multiple selections together in a pipeline.
