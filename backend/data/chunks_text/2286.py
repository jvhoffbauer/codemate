- Tests the `coerce_exclude_unset` endpoint by making a GET request and checking that the expected JSON response is returned with specific keys included (`aliased_name`, `price`) but an unset key excluded (`quantity`) due to coercion settings in the schema definition. - Uses Flask's built-in testing client to simulate HTTP requests, which allows for easy integration testing of API endpoints without having to spin up a separate server process or make external network calls.
