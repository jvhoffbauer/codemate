- Defines a function `over()` that takes several optional arguments for specifying window functions in SQL queries using SQLAlchemy's `Over` class. - The first argument is a required `FunctionElement`, which represents the analytic function to be applied within the window frame (e.g., SUM(), COUNT(), MAX()). - The `partition_by` and `order_by` parameters allow you to specify columns or expressions used to define partitions and sorting orders respectively. These are passed through directly to the underlying SQL syntax. - The `range_` and `rows` options let you further refine how many rows should be included in each partition and/or how many rows should be returned from each grouping. Again, these values are translated into SQL clauses as needed by the database driver being used.
