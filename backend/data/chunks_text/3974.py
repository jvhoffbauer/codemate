- Generates an OpenAPI v3.1 JSON schema for a FastAPI application using `client.get("/openapi.json")`.
- The generated schema includes information about endpoints (e.g., GET request to read a file), responses (including error codes and descriptions), parameters, and data types.
- The schema also defines custom validation errors that can be returned by the API, with detailed error messages provided in the response body.
