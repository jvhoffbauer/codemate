- This function is a callback for the `mkdocs serve` command's navigation generation process (`on_nav`)
- It takes several arguments including the current navigation tree (`nav`), configuration settings (`config`), and file metadata (`files`)
- The function generates a list of renamed section items using another helper function called `generate_renamed_section_items`, which may depend on the configuration settings provided to it (`config`)
