- Monkey patches `multipart.multipart.parse_options_header` to raise no exception and tests if a specific RuntimeError is raised when running an endpoint that accepts multipart/form-data files without installing the required library (in this case, `python-multipart`) using PyTest's `pytest.raises`. - The `Form` parameter expects a string value from the request body, while the `UploadFile` parameter expects a file object uploaded through the request body. Both parameters are decorated with Pydantic's `@app.get` decorator for automatic validation based on their respective types.
