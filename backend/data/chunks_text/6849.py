- Defines a fixture named `normal_user_token_headers`, scoped to the module level (i.e., available for all tests in this file). - Uses the `authentication_token_from_email()` function from an external library or custom implementation to generate an authorization token based on the test user's email address and associated credentials stored in the database. - Returns the generated headers as a dictionary containing the necessary HTTP request headers required by the API under test for authenticated requests using the OAuth2 Bearer Token scheme.
