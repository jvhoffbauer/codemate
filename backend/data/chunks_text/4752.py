- This endpoint returns a recursive data structure represented as a JSON object with a key `"name"` and an array of sub-objects under the key `"sub_items"`. - The returned object is annotated using Pydantic's `response_model` decorator, which specifies that the expected response format should conform to the `RecursiveItem` model defined elsewhere in the application. - The implementation uses hardcoded values for simplicity but could be replaced by more complex logic to dynamically generate the nested list based on some business requirements or database queries.
