- Defines a cached property called `model_insfields` for the current class (presumably a subclass of SQLAlchemy's `DeclarativeBase`) using the `@cached_property` decorator from the `functools` module in Python standard library. - The value returned by this property is a list of `SqlaInsAttr` objects, which are instances of a custom type representing SQLAlchemy's "insert statement" attributes. - This list is generated by filtering the values of all attributes defined on the current class's underlying Python object (i.e., its `__dict__`) using the `filter_insfield()` method provided by an instance of the `Parser` class, presumably also part of some third-party library or framework being used alongside SQLAlchemy.
