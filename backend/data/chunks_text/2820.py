- Tests that a GET request to `/query/param-required/int` with no query parameter for 'int' results in a HTTP status code of 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and an error message indicating that the 'int' query parameter is required. - The error message conforms to the JSON API specification format defined by Pydantic. - This test case also includes a fallback implementation for older versions of Pydantic (v1) which will be removed once support for those versions has ended.
