- Attempts to create a SQLAlchemy column for an `Optional[int]` field without passing any arguments to `Field`, which is not allowed by SQLModel's `Field` decorator. - Raises a `RuntimeError` exception because of the violation of SQLModel's constraints on using `sa_column_args`. - The error message should contain information about the expected usage of `sa_column_args` in conjunction with `sa_column`.
