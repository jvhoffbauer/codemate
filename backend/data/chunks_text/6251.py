- Defines a class fixture called `mock_client_session_class` that exposes an `AsyncMock` object for testing HTTP requests using PyTest fixtures in unit tests written with Python's built-in `unittest`. - The `httputils.CLIENT_SESSION` global variable is assigned the value of the `mock_client_session` attribute of the test case (`request.cls`) during setup, allowing it to be accessed and manipulated within the test methods. - A new method named `mocked_session_get` is defined as part of this fixture, which can be used to replace the behavior of the `ClientSession.get()` method when making HTTP requests. This allows developers to simulate different response scenarios without actually sending network traffic or interacting with external services.
