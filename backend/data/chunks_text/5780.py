- Defines a cached property `registered_admin_actions` that returns a dictionary of all available actions for this model's administration interface. - Initializes an empty dictionary called `admin_actions`. - Adds several predefined actions (e.g., create, update, delete) with their respective labels and flags using the `AdminAction` class from django-suit. - Checks whether certain features are enabled or not (such as bulk creation or reading) and adds corresponding actions accordingly. - Calls any custom action makers defined by subclasses and adds them to the dictionary under their names.
