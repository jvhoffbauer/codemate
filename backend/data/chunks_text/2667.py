- Defines a FastAPI route with the `/response_model-no_annotation-return_invalid_dict` path and returns an invalid dictionary as the response body, which should raise a validation error due to missing required fields in the User model. - The `response_model` parameter is used to specify that the returned value conforms to the User schema, but no actual User object is being created or passed around here; instead, we're just returning a plain Python dict that happens to have some keys matching those of the User class. This can be useful for testing purposes or when you want to customize how your data is serialized without having to create complex objects. However, it may also lead to unexpected behavior if you forget to update the schema accordingly (e.g., by adding new fields).
