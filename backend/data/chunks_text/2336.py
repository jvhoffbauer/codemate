- This function tests the generation of HTML for a custom Redoc instance using Flask's `get_template` and `render_template`.
- It sets up fake URLs for the Redoc JavaScript file (`redoc_js_url`) and favicon image (`redoc_favicon_url`).
- The generated HTML is stored in the `html` variable and its contents are checked to ensure that both URLs appear within it.
