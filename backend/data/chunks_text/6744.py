- Defines a method named `my_method` using the `@ep.method()` decorator in an Elixir Phoenix project.
- Takes an argument of type `Input`, which is defined elsewhere, and returns a value of type `Output`.
- The implementation simply extracts the `x` field from the input object and returns it as part of a list inside a new `Output` struct.
