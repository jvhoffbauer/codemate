- Defines a fixture named `client` using pytest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called when the fixture is invoked in tests. - Inside the function, we first import the Flask application object (`app`) from the specified module (`docs_src.query_params_str_validations.tutorial010_py310`). - We then create a new instance of FlaskTestClient and pass it our imported `app`. - Finally, we return the created `client` for use by other test functions that invoke this fixture.
