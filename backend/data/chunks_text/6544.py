- Defines a function named `unhandled_exception` that returns an integer value (type hint)
- Raises a custom exception called `MyErrorToUnhandledException`, which is not handled within this function or in any surrounding context, causing it to propagate up the call stack and potentially trigger a program crash or other unexpected behavior
