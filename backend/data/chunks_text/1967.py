- This function is a GET request for all notes in the application's database, using FastAPI's built-in `@app.get` decorator to define an endpoint at `"/notes/"`.
- The returned data will be formatted as a list of Note objects, which are defined elsewhere in the application and conform to Pydantic's schema validation system (as specified by the `response_model` parameter).
- The actual retrieval of note records from the database is handled by SQLAlchemy's `fetch_all()` method, called on the result set generated by executing the `SELECT * FROM notes` statement via the `database` object created earlier.
