- Initializes a new instance of the class with an AdminApp object passed as argument to the constructor. - Calls the parent's constructor using Python's built-in `super()` function and passes the same AdminApp object. - Checks if the schema attribute is not null (i.e., has been assigned a value). If it hasn't, raises an AssertionError exception with an error message that explains why this check failed. - Assigns a default value for form_path based on page_path, which seems to be another attribute of the class. The default value is constructed by concatenating the values of these two attributes separated by '/' and 'api'.
