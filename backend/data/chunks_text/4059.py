- Tests getting a validation error for a non-existent item ID using GET request and checks if status code and error message are correct. - Uses `assert` statement with `response.status_code` and `response.text` to check HTTP status code and error message respectively. - Utilizes Pytest's built-in fixture `client` to make requests against our Flask app. - Verifies that JSON response contains expected error details from Pydantic's `ValidationError`. - Includes fallback support for older versions of Pydantic (v1) by checking whether the error dictionary has specific keys or values.
