- Uses `responses` library to mock HTTP requests for unit tests
- Defines a list of input arguments and expected JSON/HTML response bodies using PyTest's parametrize decorator
- Adds each request with its corresponding body and JSON data to the `responses` cache
- Asserts that calling `app.utils.populations.fetch_populations()` succeeds in all cases except when a timeout is forced
