- Defines a `FastAPI` application and registers three endpoints for retrieving band information using different parameter types (`BandParams`, `BandExprParams`, and `BandExprParamsOptional`) from the `bandscope` library. - Tests each endpoint by making requests with various query parameters, checking that the expected results are returned in JSON format. - Raises an error when required parameters are missing or invalid.
