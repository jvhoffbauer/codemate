- Defines a property called `route_init` for the current class (presumably a subclass of FastAPI's BaseModel). - The implementation of this property returns an asynchronous function named `route`, which takes a single argument, `Request`. - This `route` function is responsible for returning the initial data required to render a web page or perform some other action when the application starts up. It calls another method on the same object, `get_init_data`, and passes it the request object as an argument.
