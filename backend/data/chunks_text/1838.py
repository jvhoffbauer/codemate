- This function handles a PUT request to the `/get-or-create-task/{task_id}` endpoint with an optional query parameter `response`.
- If the specified `task_id` is not present in the global dictionary `tasks`, it creates a new key for that ID and value set as string literal "This didn't exist before". The HTTP status code is also changed from default 200 OK to CREATED (201).
- Otherwise, the existing value of the given `task_id` is returned without any modification or creation.
