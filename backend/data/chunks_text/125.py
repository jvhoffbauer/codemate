- Defines an overloaded function called `select` with three arguments: a container (`__ent0`) of type `_TCCA[_T0]`, and two scalar values (`entity_1` and `entity_2`) of types `_TScalar_1` and `_TScalar_2`, respectively. - Returns a new object of type `Select[Tuple[_T0, _TScalar_1, _TScalar_2]]`. This is likely a custom data structure used to represent selected elements from the original container based on certain conditions or criteria specified by the scalar values. The specific implementation details are not provided in this snippet.
