- Defines a function `read_current_user` that takes an optional argument `current_user` of type `User`, with a default value provided by the `Depends()` decorator and its `get_current_user` dependency resolver. - The function returns the value of the `current_user` parameter, which can be either the user passed as an argument or the one obtained from the authentication middleware using `get_current_user`. This allows for easy access to the currently authenticated user in other functions without having to pass it around explicitly.
