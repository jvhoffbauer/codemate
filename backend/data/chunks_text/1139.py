- This function is a dependency for obtaining an access token using the `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm`. - It authenticates the user with the provided credentials from the fake database and raises an exception if authentication fails. - If successful, it creates an access token with an expiration time of ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES minutes and returns it along with the bearer token type.
