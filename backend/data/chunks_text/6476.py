- Overrides the default `__hash__()` method of Python objects to provide a customized hashing algorithm for this specific object (presumably, an instance of some class). - The hashed value is calculated based on the path property of the entrypoint route associated with this object. This could potentially be useful in situations where unique keys are required or when using data structures that rely on key-based access such as dictionaries and sets.
