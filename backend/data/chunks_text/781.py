- Defines a property named `is_testing` for the current class (presumably a subclass of some base class). - The value of this property is determined by comparing the instance on which it's called with another attribute, `TESTING`, also presumably defined in the same class or its parent classes. - This implementation returns True if the two objects are equal, implying that the object being accessed has been configured for testing purposes.
