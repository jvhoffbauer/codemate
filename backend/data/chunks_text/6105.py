- Automatically registers a SQLAlchemy CRUD for the `User` model and its corresponding JSON schema in the FastAPI application at test time (using pytest fixtures). - This allows for easy testing of endpoints that interact with this resource without having to manually define routes or create instances of the CRUD object. - The `TableModelParser` class is used to extract the necessary fields from the database table's metadata to generate the JSON schema automatically.
