- Defines a GET request for the path "/path/float/{item_id}" using FastAPI's decorator syntax (@app.get)
- The parameter {item_id} is bound to a floating point number (float) and passed as an argument to the function
- The function returns the value of the bound parameter, which can be used in further processing or returned directly to the client
