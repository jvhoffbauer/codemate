- This function handles OAuth2 token refreshing by decoding the provided refresh token and verifying its authenticity with a secret key. - If the token is invalid, it raises a `HTTPException` with a specific error message. - The function retrieves the associated user from the database based on the sub claim in the token's payload. - If the user doesn't exist, another `HTTPException` is raised with a different error message. - Finally, the function generates a new access token response using the user ID as the subject.
