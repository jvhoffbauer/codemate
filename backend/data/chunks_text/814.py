- This endpoint is used to create a new user and returns basic information about the newly created user in JSON format (in this case, just the email address). - The `AuthUser` parameter is an instance of a custom Pydantic model that validates the input data according to specific business rules (e.g., email format, password strength). - The `service.create_user()` function is responsible for actually creating the user in the database or other storage mechanism. It takes the `AuthUser` object as its argument and returns a dictionary representing the newly created user with appropriate keys/values.
