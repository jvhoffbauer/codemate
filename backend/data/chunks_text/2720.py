- Defines a function named `response_model_union_no_annotation_return_model1`.
- The function returns an instance of `DBUser`, which is assumed to be a custom model representing user data, with fields for name, surname, and password hash.
- This implementation assumes that the OpenAPI specification allows union types without explicit annotations in returned models (i.e., it's automatically inferred).
