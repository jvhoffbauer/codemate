- Defines a fixture named `raw_request` for use in pytests
- Takes two arguments, `app_client` and `ep_path`, from the test environment (Fixtures are functions that return values to be used as parameters by tests)
- Returns a function called `requester` which takes three optional arguments - `body`, `path_postfix`, and `auth`. This function makes an HTTP POST request using Flask's built-in client object `app_client` with the given endpoint URL `ep_path` and additional path segment `path_postfix`. The returned response is stored in the variable `resp`.
- The `requester()` function can then be invoked within tests to make requests without having to repeat the setup logic each time.
