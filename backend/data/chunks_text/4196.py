- Sends a GET request to the "/items/" endpoint using Flask's built-in `client` object
- Asserts that the status code of the response is 200 (OK) and saves it in a variable for later use
- Compares the text content of the response with a predefined string called `html_contents`, which should be returned if the API call was successful
