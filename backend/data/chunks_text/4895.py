- This function checks whether a Couchbase bucket with the given name exists in the specified cluster and creates it if it doesn't exist yet. - It takes several arguments for configuring the new bucket, such as its name, RAM quota, and type (Couchbase or Memcached). - The function returns `True` if the bucket already exists, otherwise it calls another function called `create_bucket()`.
