- This function is an asynchronous method called when a FastAPI application receives a new HTTP request. - It checks whether the incoming request is of type `"http"` using the `scope` dictionary passed to it. - If so, it creates a `Request` object from the `scope`, which contains information about the request such as URL, query parameters, headers, etc. - The function logs some debug messages containing relevant details extracted from the request (URL, query strings, headers). - After logging, it passes control back to the main FastAPI app by calling its own `__call__()` method with the same arguments.
