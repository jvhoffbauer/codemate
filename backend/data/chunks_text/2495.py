- Defines a function named `read_root` with an empty body (pass statement) marked as not to be executed during testing using the `pragma:nocover` directive provided by PyCharm's built-in coverage tool. This is likely used for functions that are called externally and cannot be tested directly within this module, but still need to be defined for compatibility or documentation purposes.
