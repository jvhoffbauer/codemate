- This method is a private helper function for retrieving the URL of a specific band (e.g., red, green, blue) from the input directory. - It takes a `str` argument representing the name of the desired band and returns its corresponding TIFF file path in the input directory using Python's built-in `os.path.join()`. - The returned value is assigned to a variable named `band_url`, which can be used by other methods or functions within this class.
