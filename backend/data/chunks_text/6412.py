- Defines a function `build_data_model` that takes a class as an argument and returns a Pydantic model representing its data structure. - Checks whether the class already has a defined DataModel attribute; if so, it renames it to avoid naming conflicts with other components in the same scope. - If no DataModel exists, retrieves the error model for this component using the `get_error_model` method of the class. - Determines whether errors are required based on a flag provided by the class. - Creates a dictionary of fields for the new model, including an optional list of errors represented by the error model. - Generates a unique name for the new model and creates it using the `create_model` function from Pydantic's base classes. - Wraps the newly created model with a custom decorator called `component_name`, which adds the module name to the model's fully qualified name to prevent naming collisions between different components.
