- Defines a function `response_model_no_annotation_return_invalid_model()` that returns an instance of `Item`.
- The `Item` class is not defined within this function, which means it's assumed to be imported from another module or defined elsewhere in the same file (outside the scope of this function).
- Since there are no type hints for `Item`, Pydantic will raise an error when trying to parse the returned object as a JSON response body, since it won't know how to validate and convert it into a Python data structure.
