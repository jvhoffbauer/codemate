- This function is a GET request for retrieving items from the API, with an optional `ads_id` parameter passed through a cookie named "ads_id". - The `Cookie` decorator is used to parse and set cookies in FastAPI requests. In this case, it sets the default value of the `ads_id` parameter to `None`. - If the `ads_id` cookie exists, its value will be passed as a query parameter to the function; otherwise, `None` will be passed.
