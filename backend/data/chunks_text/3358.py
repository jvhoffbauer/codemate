- This function tests the `GET /text` endpoint by making a request using Flask's built-in testing client and checking that it returns an HTTP status code of 200 (OK). - The expected response body is hardcoded as a string literal ("Hello World"), which is compared against the actual response text after converting both to strings for comparison purposes. - If the status code or response text doesn't match expectations, an AssertionError exception will be raised with the failed condition as its message.
