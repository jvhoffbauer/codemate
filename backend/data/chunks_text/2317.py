- Defines a function `return_fast_uuid()` that returns a dictionary containing an instance of `MyUuid`, which is a custom UUID class derived from Python's built-in `uuid.UUID`.
- Initializes and asserts the correctness of the `MyUuid` object using its constructor and the string representation of a specific UUID value.
- Asserts that `MyUuid` inherits from `uuid.UUID` but has a different name (i.e., it overrides the default naming convention).
- Raises a `TypeError` when attempting to access the variables of the `MyUuid` object directly, since this behavior is not supported by the original `uuid.UUID` implementation.
