- This function uses `aiohttp`'s built-in testing client to simulate HTTP requests and responses for a login endpoint (`/token`) with provided credentials ("johndoe" and "secret"). - The function asserts that the status code of the response is 200 OK and saves its text for debugging purposes if necessary. - It then extracts the access token from the JSON response body and checks whether it contains the expected key ("access_token") and value type ("bearer").
