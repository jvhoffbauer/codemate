- This endpoint is used to reset a password using a provided token and new password. - The `verify_password_reset_token` function checks the validity of the token. If it's invalid or expired, an error is raised. - The email associated with the token is retrieved from the database using the `crud.user.get_by_email` function. - If the user doesn't exist in the database, another error is raised. - The active state of the user is checked before updating their password hash. - After updating the password hash, the changes are committed to the database. - A success message is returned as JSON.
