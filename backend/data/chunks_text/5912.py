- This method is an asynchronous function called `_call`.
- It takes three arguments: `admin`, which represents a Django model's administration interface; `request`, representing the current HTTP request being processed by Django; and `sel`, which is a pre-existing SQL query object that will be filtered based on user input.
- If there are no filters defined for this particular filter widget (stored in `self.filters`), then the original unmodified query object (`sel`) is returned without any changes. Otherwise, the `filter()` method of the query object is used to apply the specified filters before returning the modified query object.
