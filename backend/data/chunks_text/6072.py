- Prepares a database for testing by dropping and recreating all tables defined in `models.Base`.
- Uses an SQLAlchemy connection to perform these operations synchronously within a transaction using the `db.engine` object provided by Alembic's `DatabaseContext`.
- Yields control back to PyTest so that other fixtures or tests can use this prepared state before cleaning up again at the end of the test session.
