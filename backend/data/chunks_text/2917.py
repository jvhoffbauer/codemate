- Tests HTTP Basic Authentication with non-valid credentials (username and password) for accessing a protected resource ("/users/me") using Flask-RESTful API.
- Encodes username and secret as base64 string to create an authorization header in format "Basic [base64string]".
- Sends GET request to "/users/me" with custom Authorization header containing encoded credentials.
- Asserts that server returns HTTP status code 401 Unauthorized and WWW-Authenticate header with value "Basic realm=\"simple\"", indicating that authentication is required.
