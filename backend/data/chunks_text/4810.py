- Defines a function `update()` that takes several arguments related to Couchbase operations (bucket, document ID, updated document, etc.) and returns an updated version of the document. - Copies the original document into a new one called `doc_updated`, merging it with any updates passed in as a second argument using PyDantic's copy method. - Encodes the resulting dictionary representation of the updated document for storage in Couchbase. - Uses Couchbase's durability feature to ensure consistency between replicas by specifying how long to wait before returning control to the caller (in seconds). - Upserts the encoded document into Couchbase with an optional TTL value (time-to-live), which determines how long the document will be stored before being automatically deleted.
