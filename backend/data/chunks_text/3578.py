- Tests HTTP Basic Authentication with non-valid credentials (username 'john' and password'secret') by encoding them in base64 format and passing as Authorization header to the API endpoint '/users/me'. - Verifies that the server returns a 401 Unauthorized status code along with WWW-Authenticate header set to 'Basic', indicating that authorization is required for accessing the resource. - Checks if the server responds with an error message containing 'Invalid authentication credentials' when invalid credentials are provided.
