- Sets up a temporary directory for testing and changes working directory to it
- Creates a new SQLite database named 'test.db' in this directory, unless it already exists (in which case it is deleted first)
- Imports the `test_sql_app` module from another file within the same package, but creates a new Python interpreter for it using `importlib.reload()`. This ensures that any side effects of importing the module, such as initializing a database connection or running setup code, are executed again during each test run.
- Calls the `test_create_user()` function from the imported module to perform some tests related to user creation in the newly created database.
- Deletes the 'test.db' file at the end of the test, regardless of whether it was successfully created or not.
- Changes back to the original working directory before exiting the test.
