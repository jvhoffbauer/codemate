- This function takes an authentication token as input and returns the corresponding user object from a dictionary called `users`. - The returned value is of type `User`, which can be assumed to be a custom class representing a user in this application's context. - If the provided auth_token is not found in the `users` dictionary, it's unclear what behavior this function would have; further investigation or error handling may need to be added for such cases.
