- Tests if passing an integer greater than 3 as a path parameter to `/path/param-lt-gt-int/{item_id}` raises a validation error with status code 422 and appropriate message in JSON response body. - Uses Pytest's built-in fixture `client` for making HTTP requests against our Flask app, which returns a Client object that can be used to make requests using various methods like GET, POST, etc. - The `assert` statement checks whether the server responds with expected HTTP status code (422) and compares the JSON response body with expected values using Python's built-in `isinstance()` function.
