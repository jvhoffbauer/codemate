- Defines a fixture named `client` using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The fixture takes an argument, `app`, which is assumed to be a FastAPI application instance passed from another test function or fixture. - Inside the fixture, creates a new instance of FastAPI's built-in testing client called `client`. - Returns the newly created `client` object for use in other tests that require access to a live FastAPI server.
