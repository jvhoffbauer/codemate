- Defines a function `read_items` with an optional parameter `q`. If not provided, it defaults to None. This is achieved using Pydantic's `Query()` class which allows for query parameters in URLs and forms. - The function body is empty (indicated by `pass`) but has been marked as "not covered" by test coverage tools using the `pragma: no cover` directive. This likely means that this function needs further implementation or testing before being considered complete.
