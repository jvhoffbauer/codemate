- Defines an asynchronous function `handle()` that takes a `Request`, a `BaseModel` instance (containing user credentials), and optional keyword arguments.
- Returns a `BaseApiOut` object containing either success or error information based on whether the provided username and password match a hardcoded value ("amisadmin").
- The returned token is not actually used by Amis for authentication; it's just a placeholder in this example implementation.
