- This function tests the `GET /keyword-weights/` endpoint using Flask's built-in testing client (client). - It asserts that the status code of the response is 200 and saves it in a variable called'response'. - If the status code is not 200, an error message is displayed instead of the expected JSON data. - The actual JSON returned by the server is compared to the expected JSON ('{"foo": 2.3, "bar": 3.4}' in this case) using Python's built-in json module.
