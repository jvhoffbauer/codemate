- Defines an `info` method for registering the `/info` and `/info.geojson` endpoints using FastAPI's dependency injection system.
- Uses the `@app.get("/info")` decorator to define the `GET /info` route that returns the dataset's basic information in JSON format (as specified by the `response_model`, `response_model_exclude_none`, and `responses` arguments). Dependencies such as the path of the input file, reader parameters, and environment variables are passed through the `Depends` function. The data is read from the source file using the `Reader` class, and its metadata is returned via the `info()` method.
- Similarly, uses the `@app.get("/info.geojson")` decorator to define the `GET /info.geojson` route that returns the same information but in GeoJSON format (as specified by the `response_model`, `response_model_exclude_none`, and `responses` arguments). This time, the resulting GeoJSON object consists of a single feature representing the bounds of the dataset.
