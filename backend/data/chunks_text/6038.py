- Registers a custom user admin interface for Django's built-in `django.contrib.auth.models.User` model using Django Admin Site (`@site.register_admin`) decorator and defines a new subclass of `django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin`. - Allows administrators to manage users through an enhanced, customizable interface provided by Django Admin instead of the default one. - Provides additional features such as filtering, sorting, searching, and inline editing capabilities that are not available in the standard Django admin interface.
