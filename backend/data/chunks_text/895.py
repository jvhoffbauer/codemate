- This is a class method named `_validate`, which takes two arguments (`__input_value` and `_`) but we're ignoring the second one for now. - The function checks whether the input value is an instance of `StarletteUploadFile`. If it isn't, it raises a `ValueError` with a custom error message that includes the type of the actual input value. - After passing validation, the function returns the original input value as a `UploadFile` object using Python's built-in `cast()` function to explicitly convert its type.
