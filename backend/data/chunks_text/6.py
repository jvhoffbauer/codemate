- Initializes an object with options for defining relationships between SQLAlchemy models using various parameters such as `back_populates`, `link_model`, and `sa_relationship`. - If both `sa_relationship` and either `sa_relationship_args` or `sa_relationship_kwargs` are provided, raises an error since this is not currently supported by SQLAlchemy. - Sets attributes based on user input to be used later in defining relationships between models.
