- Defines a function `fake_hash_password` that takes in a string argument `password`. - Concatenates the prefix "fakehashed" with the input password and returns the result as the hashed password. - This is a simple mock implementation of a hash password generation method for testing purposes, where the actual password is returned unchanged (i.e., no real hashing algorithm is used).
