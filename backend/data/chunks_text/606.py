- This function tests the `tutorial002` module in the SQLAlchemy tutorial section of FastAPI documentation using pytest's `clear_sqlmodel` fixture to clear any existing database connections and tables before running each test case. - It imports the specific module being tested (`tutorial002`) and sets its required variables, such as the SQLite URL and engine connection string. - The `create_engine()` function is used to establish a connection to the specified SQLite database. - A mock object for the built-in Python print statement is created using `get_testing_print_function()`, which captures all printed output during execution and stores it in a list called `calls`. - The mock print statement is patched into the main program flow using `patch()` so that any console outputs are redirected through this mock instead of printing directly to the console. - Finally, the `main()` method of the `tutorial002` module is executed within the context of the mock print statement, allowing us to capture and verify the expected console output.
