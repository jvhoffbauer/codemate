- Defines a function called `post_form_param_list` that takes an optional argument `items`, which is initialized as an empty form object (`Form()`) by default. - The returned value of this function is the `items` parameter, which can be either the original input or modified through the `Form()` class if passed explicitly to the function call. - This function allows for easy parsing and validation of user inputs submitted via HTTP POST requests using Flask's built-in `WTF` forms library.
