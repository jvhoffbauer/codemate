- Defines a fixture named `event_loop` with session scope using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - Returns a generator that yields an instance of `asyncio.AbstractEventLoop`. - Closes the event loop at the end of the test session using `loop.close()`. This allows for sharing a single event loop across all tests in the session, improving performance and reducing resource usage.
