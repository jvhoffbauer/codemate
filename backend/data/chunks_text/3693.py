- Tests that making a GET request to `/items/plumbus` with an invalid header (i.e., missing 'X-Token' header) returns a HTTP status code of 422 and a JSON error message containing details about the missing field requirement. - The JSON error message conforms to the Pydantic validation schema for missing fields, as defined by the `IsDict` type hint. - This test is marked with the `@needs_py39` decorator because it requires Python 3.9 or higher due to the use of f-strings in the URL generation.
