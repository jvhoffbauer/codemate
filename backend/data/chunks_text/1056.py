- Defines a function `is_async_gen_callable` that takes a callable object as an argument (`call`) and returns a boolean value indicating whether it's an async generator or not. - Uses Python's built-in `inspect` module to check for two cases:
   - If the given callable is itself an async generator function (i.e., has the `async def` syntax), then it's immediately returned as true. - Otherwise, checks if there's a special method called `__call__`, which is used by some classes like functions and methods to define their own calling behavior. If this exists, we again use `inspect` to determine if its return type is an async generator.
