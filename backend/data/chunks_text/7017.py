- Deletes a specific item with the given ID from the database using FastAPI's dependency injection mechanism to retrieve necessary objects such as the SQLAlchemy session and the requested item. - Checks whether the authenticated user has sufficient privileges to perform this operation by calling `crud.user.is_superuser()`. If the user is not superuser but also did not create the item in question, raises a `HTTPException` with status code 400 and error message "Not enough permissions". - Returns the deleted item after removing it from the database using `crud.item.remove()`.
