- Creates a new User with username 'User' and password 'password', asserts that ID and attributes are correct, deletes it from the database (without flushing or committing changes), and runs another test without any issues caused by locking the SQLite database. - Bulk creates three Users with incremental IDs, checks if the response contains the expected number of items, counts them using a SQL query, and verifies that both methods return the same value.
