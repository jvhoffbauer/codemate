- Defines a function `read_items` that takes an optional list of integers as argument named `q`. If no value is provided, it uses the default value specified by the `Query` decorator (which in this case is `None`). - Returns a dictionary with a key called "q" containing either the user-provided input or the default value if none was given. This can be used to pass query parameters to other functions or endpoints without having to check for nullability explicitly.
