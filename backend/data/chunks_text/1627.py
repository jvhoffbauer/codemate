- Initializes a new instance of the class and creates a session with the database using SQLAlchemy's `DBSession`. - The `__init__` method is called when creating an object of this class, allowing us to set up any necessary resources or configurations for future use within the object. - This specific implementation sets up a connection to our application's database using SQLAlchemy's ORM (Object Relational Mapping) functionality, which allows us to interact with our data in a more intuitive way than raw SQL queries.
