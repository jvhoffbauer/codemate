- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()` that takes a single argument `commons`, which is annotated with both `dict` and `Depends(common_parameters)`. This means it expects a dictionary object passed in by another function (`get_common_parameters`) that has been decorated with the `@depends()` decorator. - The function returns a dictionary containing a message string ("Hello Items!") and the value of the `commons` parameter.
