- Defines a function `get_client()` that imports and returns an instance of Flask's test client (`TestClient`) for the application defined in `docs_src/dependencies/tutorial001_an_py39`. - The imported module is named `app`, which suggests it contains a Flask application object. - This pattern allows testing to be decoupled from the main application, making it easier to write automated tests without having to run the entire application each time.
