- Defines a `lifespan` function that takes an instance of the FastAPI application as its argument (`app`)
- Initializes the ML model with the name "answer_to_everything" using the `fake_answer_to_everything_ml_model` variable, which is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the program
- Yields control back to the main event loop, allowing other parts of the app to execute before continuing with this function's execution
- Cleans up the ML models by clearing the dictionary `ml_models`, freeing up system resources used by the loaded models
