- This function `get_current_user()` takes a token as an argument and returns the current user associated with that token using the `fake_decode_token()` function from FastAPI's built-in test client library (assuming we are testing our API). - If the token is invalid or cannot be decoded, it raises a `HTTPException` with a status code of 401 Unauthorized and sets the WWW-Authenticate header to Bearer for future requests requiring authorization.
