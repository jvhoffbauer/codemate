- This function, named `_assets_expr`, takes a parameter called `params` that is dependent on the `AssetsBidxExprParams`.
- The function simply returns the value of the `params` argument without any modifications or calculations.
- In other words, this function serves as a wrapper to pass the `params` object through to another part of the program that expects it.
