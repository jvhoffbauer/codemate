- This function checks whether a given annotation represents a sequence of upload files, as defined by Pydantic's `Field` decorator. - It first handles cases where the annotation itself is a union type (i.e., can be any of multiple types). In this case, it iterates over each argument to the union type and recursively calls itself until it finds one that satisfies the condition. If at least one such argument exists, the overall annotation is considered to represent a sequence of upload files. - Otherwise, it checks whether the annotation is a regular sequence type (as specified by Pydantic's `Sequence[T]` syntax), and ensures that all its arguments are either upload file types or non-nullable upload file types (which are represented by custom annotations).
