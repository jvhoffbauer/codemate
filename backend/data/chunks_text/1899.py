- Defines a new route handler function called `custom_route_handler`.
- Uses an `async` decorator to make it an asynchronous function.
- Tries to call the existing `original_route_handler` and returns its response.
- Catches `RequestValidationError`, which is raised by FastAPI's built-in validation system when there are errors in the request data.
- Converts the request body into a string using `await request.body()`.
- Creates a dictionary with error messages from the exception (`exc.errors()`) and the request body (`body.decode()`).
- Raises a new HTTPException with status code 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and passes the error details as arguments.
