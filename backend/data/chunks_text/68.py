- Checks whether a given `FieldInfo` object has the `is_noneable()` property set to true, indicating that it can accept None values. - If the field is required, returns its `allow_none` value directly. Otherwise, checks if the shape of the field is not singleton (i.e., allows multiple values), and there are no sub-fields defined for this field. This condition ensures that fields with complex structures cannot be made noneable by default. - Returns the `allow_none` value of the field regardless of whether it's required or not, as long as it's explicitly allowed using the `None` annotation in Pydantic models. Note that some types have been ignored due to potential false positives caused by mypy's static analysis limitations.
