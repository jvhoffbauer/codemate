- Generates a unique UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) using Python's built-in `uuid4()` function, which is then converted to hexadecimal format for easier handling in strings. - Sets this generated correlation ID as a global variable called `correlation_id`, using the `set()` method of the `threading.local()` class. This allows each thread or request to have its own copy of the variable without interfering with other threads/requests. - Returns the newly set correlation ID for use elsewhere in the program.
