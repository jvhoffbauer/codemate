- Initializes Sentry's Hub object and saves it in a variable called `hub`.
- Creates a new instance of Sentry's Hub class, passing the saved `hub` as an argument to configure its behavior. This is done inside a context manager that will automatically dispose of this temporary Hub when exiting the block.
- Inside the newly created Hub, clears all existing breadcrumbs (traces left by previous events).
- Adds a custom event processor using the `add_event_processor` method. The returned function from `_make_sentry_event_processor()` is passed as an argument.
- Yields control back to the caller, allowing other parts of the program to execute while still preserving the modified Hub settings for any subsequent errors or exceptions.
