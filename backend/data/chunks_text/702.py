- Defines an asynchronous function `test_view()` that takes a `Request` object as its argument and returns a dictionary with one key-value pair.
- Inside the function, logs a debug message to the application's logger using the `logger` variable (presumably initialized elsewhere).
- Retrieves the value of the HTTP header "X-Request-ID" from the incoming request and includes it in the returned dictionary under the key "correlation_id".
