- This function takes three arguments: `name`, which is a string representing the name of the field; `rel_info`, which is an object containing information about the relationship being defined (e.g., the related table and column); and `annotation`, which can be any Python data type to specify additional constraints on the field's behavior. - The function creates a temporary `ModelField` instance using the `infer()` method from SQLAlchemy's `Model` base class. This allows us to extract information about the relationship without actually creating a full model definition. - The `get_relationship_to()` function returns the actual database table or entity that this field refers to by accessing its `type_` attribute. If the field uses forward references (a feature in SQLAlchemy for defining circular relationships), it retrieves the target table through the `__forward_arg__` attribute instead.
