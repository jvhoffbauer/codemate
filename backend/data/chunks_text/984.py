- This function is a helper method for serializing sequences (such as lists or tuples) in SQLAlchemy's ORM. - It takes two arguments: `field`, which represents the model field being serialized, and `value`, which is the actual value to be serialized. - The function returns a new sequence with elements of the appropriate type based on the shape of the original sequence, using a dictionary called `sequence_shape_to_type`. - Note that there are some type annotations used here (`ModelField` and `Sequence`) that may require additional context from the surrounding codebase to fully understand their meaning.
