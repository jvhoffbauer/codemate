- Defines an asynchronous function named `create_user` that takes a single argument of type `UserCreate`. - The function returns the input `UserCreate` object, indicating that it creates and saves a new user in the system based on the provided data. - This implementation assumes that there is already a database or storage layer to handle persistence, which is not shown here for simplicity.
