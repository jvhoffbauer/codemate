- Defines a fixture named `add_path_postfix` with two possible values (`False` and `True`) passed as parameters using the `params` keyword argument of pytest's `fixture()`. - The value returned by this fixture is determined based on the parameter selected during test invocation using PyTest's `request` object. - This fixture can be used to dynamically modify the behavior of other fixtures or tests that depend on it, such as adding a path postfix to file paths for testing purposes.
