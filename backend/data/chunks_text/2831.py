- Defines a new route with HTTP method POST and path "/" using FastAPI's decorator syntax (@app.post)
- Accepts a file (binary data) as an argument named "f" of type bytes, which is passed to the function body using FastAPI's parameter syntax (f: bytes = File())
- Returns the received file object without any modifications or processing (return f), bypassing unit tests due to its side effects (pragma: nocover).
