- Defines a model called 'Hero' that has an optional integer primary key and a required string field without a default value using SQLAlchemy's SQLModel library.
- Creates a database connection and executes the necessary SQL statements to create the 'heroes' table.
- Tests creating a new instance of the 'Hero' model with a null value for its required string field. This should raise an IntegrityError when attempting to save the object due to the lack of a default value for the required field.
