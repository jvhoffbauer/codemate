- Generates an authorization header for a test user with email config.EMAIL_TEST_USER using the authentication_token_from_email function, which is likely part of Flask-Login or another Flask extension used to manage user sessions and login credentials. - Returns this generated header as a dictionary called normal_user_token_headers(). This could be used in subsequent API requests that require authentication to simulate a logged-in user's behavior without actually logging in a real user.
