- Defines a method `get_route_handler` that returns a callable function
- Creates a new function called `custom_route_handler` which wraps the original route handler (stored in `original_route_handler`) and compresses incoming requests using gzip compression before passing them to the original handler
- Returns the newly created `custom_route_handler` as the modified route handler for this class
