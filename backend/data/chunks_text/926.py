- Defines an asynchronous function `http_exception_handler` that takes a request object and an HTTP exception as arguments. - Checks whether the body of the response should be included based on the status code using the `is_body_allowed_for_status_code()` helper function (not shown). - If the body shouldn't be included, returns a simple response with just the status code and any custom headers from the exception. - Otherwise, creates a JSON response containing the error detail and sets both the status code and headers from the exception.
