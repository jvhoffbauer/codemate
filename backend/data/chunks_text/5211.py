- This function takes a GeoJSON object (either a single feature or a collection of features) as input, along with several dependencies that provide additional parameters for reading and processing the raster data. - It converts a single feature into a collection if necessary, then uses `rasterio`'s `Reader` class to open the source file at the specified path. - If no specific band selection is provided, it defaults to using all available bands. - For each feature, it extracts the relevant data using `src_dst.feature()`, passing through various parameter dictionaries for band selection, image properties, and dataset information. - The extracted data is passed to a helper function called `get_array_statistics()` to calculate statistics such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, etc., based on user-specified options. - These statistics are added to the feature's dictionary of properties under a new key named "statistics". - Finally, the modified feature or collection is returned as output.
