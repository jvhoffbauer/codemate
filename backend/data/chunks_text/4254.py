- Imports a function `test_override_in_items` from another module (`docs_src.dependency_testing.tutorial001_an_py310`) and executes it using the `test_*` naming convention for unittest tests. - The `@needs_py310` decorator is used to ensure that this test runs on Python version 3.10 or higher, as specified in PEP 621. This helps prevent regressions caused by changes in newer versions of Python.
