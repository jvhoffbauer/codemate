- This function tests whether `CeleryTracingIdsFilter`, a custom Celery filter, has a default value of '-' when no tracing IDs are available. - The `test_celery_filter_has_default_value_attributes()` function creates an instance of `CeleryTracingIdsFilter` with its constructor argument set to 'default_value'. - It asserts that this created object's `default_value` attribute is equal to '-', which confirms that it was initialized correctly.
