- Defines a function `default_user_headers` that takes a parameter `default_user`, which is an instance of the `User` class. - Inside the function, it creates a dictionary called `return` and adds a key-value pair to it with the key "Authorization" and value in format "Bearer [ACCESS TOKEN]". The ACCESS TOKEN here is obtained by calling another method (presumably defined elsewhere) using the `default_user` object as its argument. - Finally, this dictionary is returned from the function.
