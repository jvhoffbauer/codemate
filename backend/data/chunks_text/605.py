- This function tests a specific tutorial (tutorial001) in the SQLModel documentation by using pytest fixtures to clear the database and set up necessary variables like `sqlite_url`. - It imports the module containing the tutorial's implementation, creates an engine for connecting to the SQLite database, and sets up a mock print function that captures output during execution. - The main method of the tutorial is called within the context of this mock environment, allowing for testing without actually executing any SQL statements or printing anything to the console. - Finally, the captured output is compared against expected results stored in a variable named `expected_calls`, which can be used to verify correctness.
