- This method is called by `JSONRPCDispatcher` to add multiple middleware functions to a request/response cycle. - It iterates over each middleware function passed as an argument and creates a context manager object from it using the `__call__(self, dispatcher: JSONRPCDispatcher) -> ContextManager[Any]` signature of the middleware class. - If the returned object doesn't implement `AbstractAsyncContextManager`, a runtime error is raised with an informative message explaining what went wrong. - The created context managers are added to the exit stack (a utility provided by Python's concurrent futures module), which ensures that they will be executed in reverse order when the response is sent back to the client or an exception occurs during processing. - Finally, another context manager is added to handle exceptions that may occur while executing the middleware chain.
