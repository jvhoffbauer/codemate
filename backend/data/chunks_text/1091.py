- This function handles a POST request to the `/token` endpoint and returns an OAuth 2.0 access token in response. - The `Annotated` decorator is used to validate the incoming request body using Pydantic's `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm`. - If authentication fails (i.e., the provided credentials don't match any existing users), a `HTTPException` with status code 400 ("Bad Request") is raised. - Otherwise, a new access token is created using FastAPI's built-in `create_access_token()` function, which sets its expiration time based on the value of `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`. - Finally, the newly generated access token is returned as part of a JSON object containing both the access token itself and its associated type ("Bearer").
