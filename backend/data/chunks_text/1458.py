- Defines a function called `fake_password_hasher` that takes in a single argument, `raw_password`, of type string. - Concatenates the value of `raw_password` with a fixed string ("supersecret") and returns the result as the hashed password. This is a simple implementation of a password hash function that doesn't actually provide any security; it's just used for testing purposes or demonstration.
