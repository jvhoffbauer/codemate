- This function uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` to define multiple tests with different input values for the URL path (`path`) and expects specific HTTP status codes (`expected_status`) and responses (`expected_response`) from the server. - The `client` object is used to make requests against the server using Flask's built-in testing client. - Each test case in this example checks that the correct HTTP status code is returned by the server and compares the JSON response body with an expected value.
