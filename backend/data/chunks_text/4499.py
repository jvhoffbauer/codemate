- Tests the `POST /login/` endpoint with a missing password in the request body using Pytest and Pydantic's validation features to ensure proper error handling is implemented. - Verifies that the server returns a HTTP status code of 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and an appropriate JSON response containing a list of errors indicating that the 'password' field is required. - Demonstrates how to use Pytest fixtures to inject a preconfigured instance of Flask's `TestClient` for making requests against the application under test.
