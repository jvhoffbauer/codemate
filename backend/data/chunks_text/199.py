- This function is a PATCH endpoint that updates an existing hero with ID `hero_id`. - It takes two arguments: `session`, which provides database access through SQLAlchemy's session object, and `hero_id`, which identifies the specific hero to be updated. - The `hero` argument contains the new values for the hero being updated, as defined by the `HeroUpdate` model (which is likely a subset of the full `Hero` model). - Inside the function, we retrieve the existing hero from the database using its ID, and check whether it exists or not. If it doesn't exist, we raise a 404 error. - We then merge the incoming `hero` data into the existing hero object, updating any fields that are present. - After committing the changes back to the database, we refresh the object so that any newly computed attributes (such as primary keys) are available. - Finally, we return the updated hero object.
