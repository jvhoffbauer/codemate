- This function tests uploading a file using PyTest and FastAPI's `multipart/form-data` support.
- It creates a temporary directory (`tmp_path`) to store the test file, writes some data into it, opens it in binary mode ("rb"), and passes it to the API endpoint for uploading.
- The function checks that the server returns an HTTP status code of 200 OK and verifies that the JSON response contains the correct size of the uploaded file.
