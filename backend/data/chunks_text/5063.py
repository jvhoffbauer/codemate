- Defines a new method called `get()` in the current class (presumably a subclass of another class).
- Takes a single argument `url`, which is expected to be a string containing a URL to fetch data from.
- Accepts optional keyword arguments passed through the `**kwargs` parameter, allowing for additional customization options.
- Calls the parent class's implementation of the `get()` method using Python's built-in `super()` function and passes both the `url` argument and any other provided keywords as arguments.
- Returns the response object returned by the parent class's `get()` method.
