- This function tests a specific example in the SQLAlchemy tutorial (section 009).
- It imports and runs the module `docs_src/tutorial/one/tutorial009.py`, which is part of the official SQLAlchey documentation.
- The `create_engine()` method creates an engine for connecting to a SQLite database, using the URL provided by the `sqlite_url` variable.
- A mock object called `get_testing_print_function()` is used to capture all print statements made during execution.
- The built-in `print()` function is replaced with this mock object, so that its output can be inspected later.
- Finally, the main function of the tutorial module is executed within a context manager that captures any side effects caused by printing.
- After running the tutorial, we check if the expected message was printed by comparing the captured prints with our expectations.
