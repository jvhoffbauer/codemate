- This function handles a POST request to the `/login/` endpoint and returns an access token in response. - The `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm` class from FastAPI's built-in authentication middleware is used to parse the username and password fields of the request body. - The `authenticate()` function (which we assume is defined elsewhere) checks whether the provided credentials match those of an existing user in our database. If they don't, it raises an exception with status code 400 ("Bad Request"). - If the user exists but is currently inactive, another exception with status code 400 ("Bad Request") is raised instead. - Otherwise, the `create_access_token()` function generates a new JWT access token for the user, which is included in the response as part of a dictionary containing both the access token and its type ("Bearer").
