- This test uses PyTest's `asyncio` marker to indicate that it is an asynchronous test. - The `test_staff_count()` function takes two arguments: a session object and a fixture named'staff'. - Inside the function, we create an instance of our custom async database access layer (AsyncDAL). - We then call its `all()` method with Staff as the argument to retrieve all staff records from the database. - Finally, we assert that the length of this list matches what we expect based on the number of staff in our test data.
