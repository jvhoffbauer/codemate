- This method, called "query", has been deprecated and replaced by either "session.exec()" or "session.execute()". - The reason for this replacement is that both methods have improved type annotations in SQLModel's implementation ("session.exec()") compared to the original SQLAlchemy method ("session.query()"). - If neither alternative seems like a good fit, it may be worth considering using the original SQLAlchemy method ("session.execute()") instead.
