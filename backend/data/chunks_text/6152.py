- Defines a task called `check` that takes optional arguments for formatting (`fmt`) and sorting (`sort`) checks using Black and isort respectively. It also has an argument to show differences in output (`diff`). - If neither `fmt` nor `sort` are specified, both checks will be performed by default. - The function sets up arguments for running Black and isort with their respective options, including the ability to display differences in output. - The actual execution of these commands is deferred until later, as indicated by the use of `ctx.run()`. This allows for more complex pipelines or customization before executing the tasks.
