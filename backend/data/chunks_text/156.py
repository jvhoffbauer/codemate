- Defines a function called `select` with four arguments (`entity_0`, `__ent1`, `entity_2`, and `__ent3`) that are annotated as specific types using type hints (`_TScalar_0`, `_TCCA[_T1]`, `_TScalar_2`, and `_TCCA[_T3]`). The `type: ignore` comment is used to suppress a mypy warning about unused variables named `__ent1` and `__ent3`. - Returns a new object of type `Select` which takes a tuple containing all four input values as its argument. This allows for easy chaining of multiple selection operations together in a pipeline.
