- This function retrieves a list of `Item` objects from the database using SQLAlchemy's `Session`.
- It takes optional query parameters `skip` and `limit`, which are used to paginate the results.
- If the authenticated user is an administrator (i.e., has superuser privileges), all items in the database will be returned. Otherwise, only items owned by the user will be returned.
