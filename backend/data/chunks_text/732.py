- Tests that the updated `CeleryTracingIdsFilter` maintains current behavior by setting and checking the value of `celery_current_id`.
- Verifies that the filter's default length for UUIDs (now 64 bytes instead of 32) is respected when using the old filter implementation.
- Confirms that both filters produce identical results for `celery_current_id`, indicating consistency in behavior despite the changes to the class.
