- Defines a dynamic class attribute called `mediatype` for the current class (presumably a subclass of `Media`) using the `@DynamicClassAttribute` decorator from Django's built-in utilities. - The function returns the value of the `value` property of an instance of `MediaType` with the name corresponding to this class, as obtained through the `_name_` attribute inherited from `Model`. This likely sets up a way to dynamically retrieve and use the correct MIME type based on the specific model being used in conjunction with this mixin or base class.
