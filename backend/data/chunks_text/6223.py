- `get_category` function retrieves data for a specific category (e.g., 'cases', 'deaths') and caches it both locally and remotely using Redis. - Locally, the data is cached for 30 minutes using Python's built-in `functools.cache`. Remotely, the data is cached for an hour using Redis' TTLCache feature. - If the data is already present in the remote cache, it is returned directly without making any network requests. Otherwise, the function makes a GET request to the JHU COVID-19 API, parses the resulting CSV file, normalizes the data, calculates some statistics, saves the result to the local cache, and returns the result.
