- This function takes no arguments and returns a URL string in the format required by AsyncPG to connect to a PostgreSQL database using environment variables for authentication and connection details. - The `str.format()` method is used to replace placeholders with their corresponding values from the environment variables, which are accessed using Python's built-in `os.getenv()`. - The resulting URL can be passed directly to an AsyncPG connection object to establish a secure and convenient connection to the specified PostgreSQL server.
