- This function returns an `Action` object based on a provided `request`. It first checks if there is already an existing `action`, copies it, and creates a new one with a default label and tooltip if none are specified. - The function then retrieves the `node` associated with the `action`'s type using the `getattr` function. If found, it sets its title to either the original value or the `action`'s label/tooltip, depending on which was previously unset. - Finally, the function initializes a `Service` object for the `node`'s body that makes a POST request to the router path of the current page, passing the `body` parameter as data.
