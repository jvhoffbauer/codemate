- Defines an asynchronous context manager using `@contextlib.asynccontextmanager`.
- Saves request and response details in a dictionary called `_calls`, along with any exceptions raised during method execution.
- Raises a `RuntimeError` to simulate an exception being thrown within the method body.
- Yields control back to the caller of the context manager, allowing them to continue executing their own code.
- In the finally block, saves additional request and response details, along with the same exception that was previously saved, when the context manager is exited.
