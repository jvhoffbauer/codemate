- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items` that takes a positional argument `ads_id`, which can be either a string or `None`. The type of this parameter is annotated using Pydantic's `Annotated` and `Cookie()` classes to indicate that it should be retrieved from a cookie if present. - If `ads_id` is not provided (i.e., `None`) in the function call, the function returns a dictionary with an empty key for 'ads_id'. Otherwise, the value passed in `ads_id` is included in the returned dictionary under the 'ads_id' key.
