- Sets up a temporary directory using `pytest.TempPathFactory`.
- Changes working directory to the temporary directory and creates a new SQLite database named "test.db".
- Imports the `test_sql_app` module, which contains tests for an application that uses SQL databases. The import is done inside the function body to ensure that any necessary setup or initialization occurs before running the tests.
- Reloads the imported module (to ensure that any changes made during testing don't affect subsequent runs of the same test).
- Runs one specific test case ("test_create_user") from the imported module.
- Deletes the created database file at the end of the function.
- Restores the original working directory.
