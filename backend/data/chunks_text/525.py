- Imports `tutorial005_py310` module from the 'docs_src' package and assigns it to a variable named `mod`.
- Sets the value of `mod.sqlite_url` to a SQLite URL string.
- Creates an engine using the `create_engine` function provided by SQLAlchemy, passing in the `mod.sqlite_url` as its argument.
- Initializes a list called `calls` which will be used later for testing purposes.
- Retrieves the built-in print function (i.e., Python's default printing mechanism), saves it in a temporary variable called `new_print`, and replaces the original print function with a custom one that appends each printed statement to the `calls` list instead of displaying it on the console.
- Calls the `main` method defined inside the `tutorial005_py310` module while replacing the built-in print function with our custom implementation.
- Asserts that the `calls` list contains exactly what we expect after running the `main` method.
