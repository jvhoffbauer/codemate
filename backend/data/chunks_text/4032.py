- Tests creating a new item with an empty JSON request body using FastAPI's built-in `TestClient`.
- Asserts that the server returns a HTTP status code of 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and a JSON error message containing details about missing required fields ("name" and "price"). The error message is generated by Pydantic, which is used for data validation in this application.
- Verifies that the error message conforms to the expected format defined by Pydantic's schema. This includes checking both the current version (v1.8+) and the legacy format (pre-v1.9).
