- Calls `importlib.reload()` on a module named `app_mod`, which is assumed to contain SQLModel classes for database tables. - The purpose of this is to trigger any necessary side effects that occur when these classes are imported or registered with SQLModel, such as creating database tables if they don't already exist. - This should be done after clearing out existing data from the test environment (represented by the `clear_sqlmodel` parameter), but before setting up the actual test fixtures using Pytest Fixtures.
