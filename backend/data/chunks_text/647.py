- This function tests a specific tutorial (tutorial003_py310 in the many_to_many module of the tutorial directory) using pytest's `clear_sqlmodel` fixture to clear any existing SQLModel data before running the test. - The `from... Import... As mod` line imports the tutorial module and assigns it to a variable named `mod`. - The `create_engine` function is called with the URL provided by the tutorial, which creates an engine for connecting to the database specified by that URL. - A list called `calls` is initialized to store information about print statements made during the execution of the tutorial. - The `get_testing_print_function` function is used to replace Python's built-in `print` statement with a custom implementation that adds each printed string to the `calls` list instead of actually printing it. - The `with patch` block wraps around the main function call of the tutorial, replacing the built-in `print` statement with our custom one. - After the tutorial has finished executing, we check whether the `calls` list contains the strings we expect to have been printed during the tutorial's execution. If not, the test fails.
