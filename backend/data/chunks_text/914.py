- Defines a function called `decorator` that takes in a decorated callable (a function with decorators applied to it) as an argument and returns it. - Inside the function, adds a route using Flask's built-in routing mechanism by calling the `self.add_route()` method of the Flask app instance (presumably stored in `self`) with the given `path`, `func`, `methods`, `name`, and `include_in_schema`. - Returns the original decorated callable without any modifications or wrapping.
