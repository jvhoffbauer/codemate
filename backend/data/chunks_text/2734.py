- Tests a Flask route that returns an exact dictionary without any additional annotations or decorators using the `client` object provided by Flask's testing module. - Asserts that the HTTP status code is 200 and saves the response text for debugging purposes if the assertion fails. - Uses the `assert` statement to check whether the JSON returned from the server matches the expected result (a specific dictionary).
