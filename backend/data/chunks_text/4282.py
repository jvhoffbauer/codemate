- Defines a function `get_client()` that returns an instance of Flask's built-in test client, `TestClient`, for interacting with our application's endpoints without actually making network requests or starting a server. - Imports the necessary components from our project structure (docs_src and schema_extra_example), specifically the Flask app created in tutorial001_py310. - Uses the imported app to create a new `TestClient` object, which can be used to make requests against our API as if it were being accessed over HTTP. This is useful during development and testing phases when we want to simulate user behavior without having to spin up a full web server.
