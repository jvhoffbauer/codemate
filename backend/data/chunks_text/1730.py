- Defines a function `send_notification` that takes an email address (`email`) and a `BackgroundTasks` object from FastAPI's dependency injection system (`background_tasks`) as arguments. It also accepts a query parameter `q` using Pydantic's `Annotated` decorator with a default value provided by `Depends`. - Inside the function, it constructs a message string containing the recipient's email address and concatenates it with some text. This message is then passed to another async function called `write_log`, which is added to the list of tasks managed by `BackgroundTasks`. The result of this operation is stored in a variable named `background_tasks`. - Finally, the function returns a JSON response containing a simple message indicating that the notification has been successfully sent.
