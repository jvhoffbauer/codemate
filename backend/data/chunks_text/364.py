- Tests if it's possible to instantiate a SQLModel without passing any arguments and still be able to save and retrieve data from the database using SQLAlchemy ORM. - Creates an in-memory SQLite database and sets up the necessary metadata for the `Item` model. - Uses the `Session` context manager to add, commit, and query the newly created `Item`. - Asserts that exactly one row was retrieved and checks that the generated ID is of type `int`. - Clears the metadata after testing to ensure no leftover tables are left behind.
