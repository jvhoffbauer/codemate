- This function tests the `POST /files/` endpoint of a FastAPI application by sending two files (`filea` and `fileb`) along with a token in the request body using the `TestClient`. - The `tmp_path` fixture is used to create temporary directories for storing the files being sent. - If the API call succeeds, it returns a JSON object containing information about both uploaded files, including their sizes and content types.
