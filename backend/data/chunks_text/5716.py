- This method `get_page_schema()` returns an optional `PageSchema`, which represents a schema for a specific page in a website's structure. - If there already exists a `PageSchema` object from calling its parent class (`super().get_page_schema()`), it checks that the current instance has a valid link and updates the existing `PageSchema` with this link if necessary. - The updated `PageSchema` object is then returned by this method.
