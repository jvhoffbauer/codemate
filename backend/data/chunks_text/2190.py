- Initializes a dictionary called `counter_holder` to hold the value of our counter and sets it to zero. - Makes an HTTP GET request to the root URL (`"/"`) using Flask's built-in testing client (`client`) and asserts that the status code is 200 OK. The text content of the response body is also checked for errors. - Retrieves the JSON data from the response and checks if the key 'counter' exists with a value of one. - Repeats step two but this time expects the value of the 'counter' key in the returned JSON to be two.
