- This function `get_current_username()` takes an optional argument `credentials`, which is a dependency provided by FastAPI's security feature for authentication. - The function checks whether the username and password of the authenticated user match with predefined values using Python's built-in `secrets` module to compare hashed strings securely. - If either the username or password is incorrect, it raises a customized HTTP exception with a specific error message and WWW-Authenticate header for basic authentication. - Otherwise, the function returns the authenticated username as the result.
