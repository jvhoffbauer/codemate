- Defines a new endpoint `/router` using FastAPI's router decorator with custom unique ID generation function `custom_generate_unique_id3`. - Returns a list of `Item` objects as the response body (`response_model`) and defines a specific HTTP status code (`404`) for error handling with its own response model (`List[Message]`). - Accepts two arguments named `item1` and `item2`, both of type `Item`, in the request body.
