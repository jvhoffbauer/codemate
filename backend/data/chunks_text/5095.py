- Tests filtering products by a specific attribute (product type in this case), using the `AsyncDal` class to interact with the database through SQLAlchemy ORM. - The function takes several optional arguments representing different attributes that can be used for filtering, but some of them are commented out as examples. These include color, size, category, date, datetime, and boolean attributes. - The function asserts that exactly one product is returned when all products with the specified attribute value are fetched from the database. This ensures that the filtering logic works correctly.
