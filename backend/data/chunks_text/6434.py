- This method, named `raw_response`, returns a dictionary (`dict`) containing the raw response data from an API request made by the class instance. - The returned dictionary is stored in a private attribute called `_raw_response`. - Clients of this class can access the raw response data using this public method instead of directly accessing the private attribute to maintain encapsulation and prevent unexpected side effects.
