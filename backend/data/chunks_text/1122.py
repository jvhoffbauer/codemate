- This function takes a `form_data` object containing the username and password as input using FastAPI's dependency injection mechanism (`Depends()`) to retrieve an instance of `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm`. - It authenticates the user by calling another function `authenticate_user()`, which is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the application. If authentication fails, it raises a `HTTPException` with a custom error message and WWW-Authenticate header set to Bearer. - If authentication succeeds, it creates an access token with a specified expiration time using the `create_access_token()` function from FastAPI's security library. The token contains a payload with the sub field set to the user's username. - Finally, it returns a dictionary containing the generated access token and its type ("bearer").
