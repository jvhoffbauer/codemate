- This function is asynchronous and takes an HTTP request object as input. - It tries to convert the request body to a JSON object using `asyncio`. If it fails, it raises a custom exception called `ParseError`. - The function checks whether the parsed JSON is a non-empty list. If it's empty, it raises another custom exception called `InvalidRequest` along with some error details. - Otherwise, it returns the parsed JSON.
