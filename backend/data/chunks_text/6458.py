1. Defines a function `handle_req_to_resp` that takes multiple arguments related to HTTP requests and responses, JSON RPC contexts, dependencies, and errors.
2. Creates a new JSON RPC context using the provided parameters and enters middleware functions defined in the endpoint's configuration.
3. Checks whether the requested method matches the configured name of this endpoint; raises an exception otherwise.
4. Calls another function `handle_req` passing it all relevant information from the current request/context, along with any additional dependencies or error handling options.
5. Sets the response object returned by `handle_req` into the JSON RPC context for further processing (e.g., serialization).
6. Returns the final serialized response from the JSON RPC context.
