- Defines a function `cloned_field()` that creates a new model field based on an existing one. - Uses the `create_cloned_field()` helper function to clone the original field's metadata (i.e., its type and constraints). - If using Django Rest Framework version 2 or later, merges the original field's metadata with any custom updates provided by the user via keyword arguments. - Otherwise, simply copies over all of the original field's update options directly onto the new field.
