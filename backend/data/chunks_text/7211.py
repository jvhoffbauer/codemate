- Takes an SQLAlchemy object (either a query result set or a single row) as input and returns it in either dictionary or list format suitable for JSON encoding. - Uses `json.dumps()` to convert Python objects into JSON strings, with custom encoder function `_alchemy_encoder` provided by SQLAlchemy's ORM module to handle converting database column types like timestamps and foreign keys into their corresponding JSON representations. - If the input is a list of rows returned from executing a SELECT statement using fetchall(), each row is converted into a dictionary before being included in the resulting list. - Otherwise, if the input is a single row obtained through fetchone(), its attributes are directly transformed into a dictionary and passed back as the serialized output.
