- Defines a function called `select` with four input parameters (`entity_0`, `entity_1`, `entity_2`, and `entity_3`) of generic scalar types (_TScalar_0 through _TScalar_3). The `type: ignore` annotation is used to suppress mypy's warning about unused arguments in this case. - Returns a new object of type `Select` that takes a tuple as its argument containing all four input entities. This allows for chaining multiple selections together using the fluent interface pattern.
