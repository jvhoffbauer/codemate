- This function is a validator decorator that modifies the `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS` setting before it's used by Django Rest Framework.
- It converts a single string value into a list of strings separated by commas or spaces, unless the input already contains square brackets indicating a list format.
- If the input cannot be converted to either a string or a list, an error is raised.
