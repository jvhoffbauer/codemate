- Defines a function `get_coerce()` that returns a dictionary with three key-value pairs representing name, date, and price of an object called 'coerce'
- The value for the 'date' key is set to a specific point in time using Python's built-in `datetime` class and its string formatting method `isoformat()`. This ensures that the date is represented in a standardized format that can be easily parsed by other systems or applications.
- The value for the 'price' key is set as a simple string representation of the decimal number 1.0. While this may not strictly adhere to any particular pricing convention, it serves as a placeholder value for demonstration purposes within the context of this example.
