- This endpoint returns a dictionary with exact keys and values representing a `User` object, without using a custom response model annotation. - The function's return type is explicitly set to `User`, indicating that FastAPI will automatically convert the returned dictionary into a JSON response with the correct schema based on the `User` class definition. - Using this approach allows for more flexibility in returning complex data structures from endpoints while still maintaining strong typing and documentation through the use of classes.
