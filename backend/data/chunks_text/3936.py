- Sends a GET request to `/items/` with multiple query parameters (`q=foo` and `q=bar`) using Flask's built-in testing client. - Asserts that the server returns an HTTP status code of 200 and displays its text content if it doesn't. - Parses the JSON response body and asserts that it contains an array with both query values ("foo" and "bar").
