- Defines a FastAPI `@property` called `dependency`, which returns a function named `post_processing`.
- The `post_processing` function is a decorator that can be applied to API endpoints to add data processing functionality after retrieving data from the database.
- It takes two optional query parameters: `algorithm` (the name of the desired algorithm) and `algorithm_params` (a JSON string containing any necessary parameters for the selected algorithm). If either parameter is not provided, the function returns `None`.
- Inside the function, it attempts to retrieve the specified algorithm using its name and any associated parameters. If an error occurs during this process, a `ValidationError` exception is raised with a status code of 400 and a detailed message describing the issue. Otherwise, the processed data is returned.
