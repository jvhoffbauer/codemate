- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()`. - Returns a predefined dictionary called `fake_items_db`, which is assumed to contain data for multiple items. - This function can be used to efficiently retrieve all item information without making any external requests or database queries, since it returns a local variable instead of fetching data from a remote server or database.
