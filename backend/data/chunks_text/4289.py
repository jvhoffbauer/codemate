- Defines a function `get_client()` that returns an instance of Flask's built-in test client, `TestClient`, for interacting with our application's endpoints without actually making network requests or starting up a server. - Imports the necessary components from our project structure (docs_src and tutorial005_an_py39), which are required to create the `TestClient`. - Uses the imported `app` object as the argument when creating the `TestClient`. This is because we want to use this specific version of our application in our tests, rather than running it separately each time.
