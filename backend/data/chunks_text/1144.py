- This function is an asynchronous (async) method that returns a list of users, but it's not implemented yet because we're focusing on authentication for now. - It takes a `User` object named `current_user` as a dependency using the `Depends()` decorator to retrieve the currently authenticated user from FastAPI's built-in security middleware called JWTBearer(). - The returned value is the retrieved `User` object itself, which can be used in other functions or views later on.
