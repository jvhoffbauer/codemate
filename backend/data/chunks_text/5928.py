- Defines a function `model_config` that takes a type of BaseModel as an argument (`model`) and returns either its Config class or a dictionary representing its configuration options. - The returned value can be either the original Config class (as a type) or a customized dictionary with specific configuration values overriding some defaults. This allows for more flexibility in configuring models during training or evaluation.
