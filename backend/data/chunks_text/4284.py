- Defines a fixture named `client` using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called by PyTest when it needs an instance of the `client`. - Inside the `get_function()`, we first import the Flask application object (`app`) from our tutorial example at `docs_src/schema_extra_example/tutorial005`. - We then create a new `TestClient` object for this application and store it in the variable `client`. - Finally, we return the `client` object so that other tests can use it as needed.
