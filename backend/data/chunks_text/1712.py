- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()` that takes two optional arguments: `item_id` and `q`.
- Uses Pydantic's `Path` and `Query` decorators to validate and parse input values for these arguments.
- Returns a dictionary called `results`, which contains either just the `item_id` or both `item_id` and `q`, depending on whether they were provided in the argument list.
