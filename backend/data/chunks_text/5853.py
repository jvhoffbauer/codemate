- Defines an `async` function called `file_upload` that takes a single argument `file`, which is of type `UploadFile`. This parameter is decorated using FastAPI's `File` class to handle file uploading. - The function extracts the filename from the `file` object using the `get_filename` method (not shown here). - It creates a path for saving the file in the specified directory, creating any necessary parent directories along the way. - Uses Python's built-in `os.makedirs` function to create the required directories. - Reads the contents of the file into memory using the `aiofiles.open` context manager. - Checks whether the maximum allowed file size has been exceeded by comparing its length against the value stored in the `file_max_size` attribute. If so, returns an error message. - Saves the file content to disk using another `aiofiles.open` context manager. - Returns a JSON response containing details about the saved file, including its name and URL.
