- This function tests the `tutorial001` example in the SQLModel documentation using pytest's `clear_sqlmodel` fixture to clear any existing database connections and tables before running each test case. - It imports the specific module for this tutorial (`tutorial001_py310`) and sets up the necessary variables, such as the SQLAlchemy engine and URL. - The `get_testing_print_function` is used to capture all print statements made during execution of the main function, which are stored in a list called `calls`. - Finally, the `patch` decorator replaces Python's built-in `print` function with our custom one that captures output, allowing us to verify that the correct messages were printed by the program under test.
