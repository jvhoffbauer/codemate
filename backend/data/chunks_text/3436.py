- This function is an asynchronous callable that handles HTTP requests and responses in Starlette framework. - It checks whether the request type is 'http' and maximum content size is not null before proceeding with handling the request using `await self.app()`. - If either of these conditions are false, it immediately returns without further processing. - Otherwise, it wraps the original `receive` object to limit the amount of data received based on the configured max content size, passes this wrapped object along with the updated `send` object to `self.app()`, and then returns.
