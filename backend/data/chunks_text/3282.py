- Defines a Pydantic model `ModelWithDatetimeField` that includes a datetime field and sets up JSON encoding for it using the `Config` class. - Creates an instance of the model with a specific datetime value. - Registers a route in FastAPI to serve the model as a response. - Uses the built-in `TestClient` from FastAPI's testing module to make a GET request to the registered route and returns the response as a dictionary. - Asserts that the returned JSON contains the expected formatted datetime string.
