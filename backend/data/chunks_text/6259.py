- Inside this function, creates an inner class called `TestTimeline` with an initializer that accepts a single argument `latest`. This is assigned to an instance attribute of the same name.
- Returns the newly created `TestTimeline` object, passing in the first element from the list of arguments passed into `mocked_timeline` as the value for `latest`.
