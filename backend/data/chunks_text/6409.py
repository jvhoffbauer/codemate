- Defines a class method `get_data_model` that returns an instance of the data model for this class, or builds and caches it if it hasn't been created yet. - Checks whether the `data_model` attribute already exists in the current class dictionary (i.e., has been set before). If so, simply returns it without creating a new one. - Otherwise, calls another method `build_data_model` to create the actual data model object, which may involve loading data from external sources or performing other setup tasks. The resulting object is then assigned to the `data_model` attribute of the class, effectively making it available as a singleton across all instances of this class. Finally, the original call to `get_data_model` returns the newly constructed data model object.
