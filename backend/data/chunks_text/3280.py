- Defines a GET endpoint at `/model` using FastAPI's decorator syntax (`@app.get`)
- Returns an instance of the `ModelWithDatetimeField` class, which is defined elsewhere in the application and has a datetime field (see previous question for details on this custom Pydantic model)
- Uses Pydantic's `response_model` parameter to specify that the response should be serialized according to the `ModelWithDatetimeField` schema
