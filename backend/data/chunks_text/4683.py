- Defines a fixture named `client` using pytest's built-in `fixture()` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called by pytest when it encounters this fixture in tests. - Inside the function, we first import the Flask application object (`app`) from a specific module within our project's documentation sources (`docs_src.request_files.tutorial001_02_py310`). - We then create a new instance of FlaskTestClient and pass it the imported `app`. This creates an HTTP request/response testing client that can be used for making requests against our Flask application. - Finally, we return the created `client` so that it becomes available as a test resource via the `client` variable defined at the top level of our tests.
