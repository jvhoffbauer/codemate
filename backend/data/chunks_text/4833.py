- This function is called `read_roles`. It retrieves roles and returns a dictionary with a key "roles" containing an enumerated list of strings representing role values from the `RoleEnum` class, which has been converted to string format using the `crud.utils.ensure_enums_to_strs()` helper method provided by FastAPI's CRUD module. - The function takes a single argument `current_user`, which is an instance of the `UserInDB` model obtained through the `Depends()` decorator that fetches the current authenticated user (in this case, a superuser). - In summary, this function provides a way to retrieve all available roles in the system as a JSON response for use in other parts of the application or API endpoints.
