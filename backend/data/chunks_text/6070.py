- Defines a custom `ArticleRead` model for reading articles with relationships to other tables (categories, contents, users, and tags) using SQLAlchemy's ORM.
- Registers an instance of `ArticleCrud`, which is a wrapper around SQLAlchemy's CRUD operations, as a FastAPI endpoint under the prefix `/article`.
- Tests that the OpenAPI documentation includes schemas for all required relationship fields.
- Makes a GET request to retrieve a specific article by ID and verifies that it contains all expected relationship data.
