- Defines a function called `all` that takes an optional argument `TileMatrixSetId`. If this argument is not provided, it retrieves a list of available TMS IDs using the `Query()` method and passes them as a tuple to the `Literal[]` type annotation. - The function returns the value passed in as `TileMatrixSetId`, or if it's not specified, it returns one of the available TMS IDs from the query result.
