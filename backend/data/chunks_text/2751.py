- Tests a Flask route that returns a JSON object with two keys (name and surname) using the ResponseModel decorator for model validation and annotation, as well as the ReturnResponse annotation to return the same model instance used in the request body. - Uses the Flask Client module to make a GET request to the specified URL and checks if the status code is 200. If not, it prints the error message along with the response text. - Asserts that the returned JSON matches the expected result by comparing it with a dictionary containing the desired values.
