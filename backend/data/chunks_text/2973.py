- This endpoint uses FastAPI's dependency injection system to pass a string value from another asynchronous method (`methods_dependency.asynchronous`) into this function using the `Depends()` decorator. - The `value` parameter is annotated with the type of the returned value from the dependent method, in this case, a string. - By making use of dependencies, we can decouple our endpoints and methods, allowing for easier testing and more modular application design.
