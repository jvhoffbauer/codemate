- This function tests uploading a file using PyTest and Flask's built-in testing client (client).
- It creates a temporary directory (tmp_path) to store the test file (path), writes some content into it (path.write_bytes()), opens it in binary mode ("rb"), and passes it to the POST request for creating a new file resource (response = client.post()).
- The function checks if the status code is correct (assert response.status_code == 200, response.text) and verifies that the JSON response contains the expected size of the uploaded file (assert response.json() == {"file_size": 14}).
