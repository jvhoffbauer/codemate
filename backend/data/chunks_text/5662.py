- This function is decorated with `@lru_cache()`, which means it will cache its results in a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache to improve performance for repeated calls with the same arguments. - It takes two positional arguments: `template_path` and an optional `encoding`. - The function returns a Jinja2 `Template` object after reading the contents of the specified file at `template_path` using Python's built-in `open()` function.
