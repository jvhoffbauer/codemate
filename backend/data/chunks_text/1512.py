- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()`.
- Accepts a single argument `q`, which is annotated with both `Query()` and `List[str]`. This allows for either a list of strings or a single string to be passed in.
- If a list is provided, it's used directly as the value for the 'q' parameter in a dictionary called `query_items`.
- If a single string is provided, it's wrapped in a list before being added to `query_items`.
