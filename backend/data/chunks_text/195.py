- This function is a GET request for retrieving all Hero objects from the database using FastAPI's dependency injection and SQLAlchemy ORM. - The `response_model` parameter specifies that the API will return a list of `HeroRead` objects (a custom model defined elsewhere in the application) as JSON data. - Two query parameters are accepted via the `Query` decorator: `offset`, which defaults to zero but can be specified by the client to skip over a certain number of results; and `limit`, which limits the maximum number of results returned at once. These values are passed through to an SQLAlchemy `SELECT` statement generated with the `select` function, along with the `Session` object obtained from the `get_session` dependency.
