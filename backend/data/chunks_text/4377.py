- This function tests the `/items/foo` endpoint with query parameters `skip="a"` and `limit="b"`, which are both invalid according to Pydantic's validation rules (i.e., `skip` is missing, and both `skip` and `limit` cannot be parsed as integers).
- The function uses Pytest's built-in `TestClient` fixture to make HTTP requests against the Flask app under test.
- If the request fails due to validation errors, the function checks that the server returns a 422 Unprocessable Entity status code and a JSON error message containing detailed information about each validation failure, including its type, location in the input data, and any relevant messages or inputs.
