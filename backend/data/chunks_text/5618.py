- Defines a method `route_read()` that returns a callable function (a coroutine).
- The inner function `route()` is an asynchronous view function that handles HTTP GET requests for reading specific resources identified by their IDs.
- It checks whether the user has read permission using `await self.has_read_permission(request, item_id)`. If not, it returns an error response.
- Otherwise, it retrieves the requested resource(s) from the database and returns them in the API output format specified by `BaseApiOut`.
