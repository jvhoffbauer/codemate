- Tests the `get_locations()` method of the JHU service by creating a mock datetime object and returning a specific ISO format string for testing purposes. - Asserts that the returned value is a list containing Location objects from the JHU API data. - Verifies that the number of locations in the returned list matches the number of locations in the lists obtained through calling `get_category()` methods for "confirmed", "deaths", and "recovered".
