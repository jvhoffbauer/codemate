- This endpoint sends a notification to an email address using FastAPI's built-in background task feature (BackgroundTasks). - The `background_tasks` parameter is used to add a new asynchronous task to be executed in the background. - The `write_notification()` function takes two arguments (the email and the notification message) and writes it to some storage or database for later retrieval by the user.
