- Defines a method `registered_admin_actions()` that returns a dictionary of AdminActions created by each instance of `AdminActionMaker`.
- Initializes an empty dictionary called `admin_actions`.
- Loops through all instances of `AdminActionMaker` and creates a new `AdminAction` object using its constructor (i.e., `maker(self)`).
- If the newly created `AdminAction` is not None or False, adds it to the `admin_actions` dictionary with its name as key.
- Returns the resulting dictionary containing all registered AdminActions.
