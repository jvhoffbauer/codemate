- Checks if a given `value` is both an instance of any built-in Python sequence (list, tuple, range, etc.) and not a string or byte array using the `isinstance()` function with the `sequence_types` class variable from the `collections.abc` module. - The check for strings and byte arrays is added to exclude them as they are considered sequences but may not be what we want in this specific context. - Note that PEP 484 suggests avoiding using `type()` directly since it can lead to unexpected behavior due to inheritance relationships between classes. Therefore, we use the `typing.TypeIgnore` hint to suppress the warning generated by mypy when checking the argument's type.
