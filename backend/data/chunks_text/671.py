- The `cleanup()` function takes keyword arguments (`**`) and returns nothing (`-> None:`). - Its purpose is to clear context variables to prevent reuse of values between tasks, specifically the `correlation_id`. - This function is necessary for worker processes because context variables are automatically cleared at the end of an HTTP request, but not during background tasks executed by Celery workers.
