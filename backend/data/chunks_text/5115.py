- Adds a new `/validate` endpoint to a COG TilerFactory using FastAPI's router decorator. - Requires 'rio_cogeo' package for validation functionality. - Accepts two arguments in query parameters: `src_path`, which is obtained from the path dependency function provided by the base class, and `strict`, which specifies whether warnings should be treated as errors during validation. - Returns an Info object containing metadata about the validated COG.
