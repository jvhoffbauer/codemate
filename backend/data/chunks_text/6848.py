- Defines a function `superuser_token_headers` that takes in an instance of Flask's test client (`TestClient`) and returns a dictionary containing authorization headers for requests made by a superuser. - The implementation is delegated to another helper function called `get_superuser_token_headers`, which is not shown here but presumably retrieves or generates a JWT token for the superuser user account.
