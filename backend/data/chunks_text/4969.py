- Defines an asynchronous function `health_check_wrapper` that takes three arguments (`scope`, `receive`, and `send`) for handling HTTP requests in FastAPI.
- Checks whether the requested URL is not equal to a specific path ('health_url') using the `scope['path']` attribute. If it's different, passes control to the main app by calling `application()`.
- Otherwise, sends a response with status code 200 and content type 'text/plain'. The headers are set through a tuple of key-value pairs passed as a list to the `headers` parameter.
- Finally, returns the body of the response using the `http.response.body` message type.
