- Defines a GET route at `"/headers/"`, which returns an HTTP response with custom headers and a payload containing a message. - The `JSONResponse()` function is used to create the HTTP response, passing both the payload (as a dictionary) and custom headers as arguments. - Two custom headers are set using a dictionary literal; these will be included in the response's header section when the request is made by the client.
