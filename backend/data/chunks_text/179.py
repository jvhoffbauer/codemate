- The `execute` function in this context is a wrapper around the original SQLAlchemy `Session.execute` method provided by SQLAlchemy's `Session` class.
- It takes several arguments including the executable statement (`statement`) and optional parameters (`params`).
- It also accepts additional options such as `execution_options`, `bind_arguments`, and `_parent_execute_state`.
- The purpose of this wrapper seems to be to provide an alternative way to execute statements using the `exec` method instead of calling `scalars` on the result set returned from `execute`.
- The documentation suggests that using `exec` may be more convenient for retrieving multiple rows at once since it eliminates the need to chain `scalars` and `all` methods together.
