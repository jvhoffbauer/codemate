- Defines a function `post_processing()` that takes two arguments `algorithm` and `algorithm_params`. The `algorithm` argument is required and must be set to a tuple of keys in the data dictionary (i.e., the names of the algorithms). This allows users to specify which algorithm they want to apply during post-processing. - If an algorithm is specified, it's passed to the `get()` method along with any keyword arguments provided by the user via the `algorithm_params` argument. These parameters are parsed as JSON before being passed to the algorithm. - If an error occurs while executing the selected algorithm, a `ValidationError` exception is raised and converted into a `HTTPException` with status code 400 and detailed message. Otherwise, the result of the algorithm is returned. - If no algorithm is specified or the input data doesn't contain all the necessary variables for the chosen algorithm, `None` is returned instead.
