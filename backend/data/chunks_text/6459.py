1. This function is an asynchronous handler for HTTP requests that uses FastAPI's middleware system (`await ctx.enter_middlewares(self.middlewares)`) and handles shared dependencies using a `DependencyCache`.
2. It checks for any shared dependency errors and copies the cache before resolving dependencies with `solve_dependencies()`, which takes into account separate dependencies for individual methods within batched requests.
3. The resulting values, errors, tasks, and responses are passed back up the chain for further processing or error handling. If errors occur during validation, an InvalidParamsFromValidationError exception is raised. Otherwise, the function calls the actual business logic (`self.func`) synchronously and returns the serialized JSON response using FastAPI's serialization utilities.
