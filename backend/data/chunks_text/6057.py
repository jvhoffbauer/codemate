- Defines a `User` model with two fields named `name` and `role`, both with aliases for use in forms. - Uses the `model_fields()` function to extract the field definitions from the `User` model. - Creates a form item using the `amis_parser.as_form_item()` function for each extracted field, passing `set_default=True`. - Asserts that the generated form items have the expected names based on their respective aliases.
