- Tests that making a POST request to `/files/` without any body data returns a HTTP status code of 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and an error message indicating that the 'files' field is required. - Uses Pytest-mock to simulate requests using Flask's built-in testing client. - Verifies that the JSON response from the server matches the expected format defined by Pydantic's validation errors.
