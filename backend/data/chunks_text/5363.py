- Tests different image file formats (PNG, PNG raw, JPEG, and WEBP) for their associated image profiles using PyTest's `parametrize()` decorator. - Uses Python's built-in enum class `ImageType` to retrieve the corresponding image type object based on the input format string. - Compares the retrieved image type's profile attribute with a dictionary of known image profiles to verify correctness.
