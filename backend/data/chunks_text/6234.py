- `get_locations()` function retrieves a list of county locations from an API endpoint and caches them for one hour. - It returns a dictionary containing the locations, which can be used by other functions in the program. - If the location data is already present in the cache, it uses that instead of making another request to the API. - The function parses the CSV file returned by the API into a list of dictionaries representing each location's attributes (such as state, county name, lat/long coordinates, etc.). - It then normalizes this data into a format suitable for use within the program, including converting dates and times to ISO formats and converting strings to integers where necessary. - Finally, it saves the resulting list of locations to the cache so they don't need to be fetched again during subsequent requests.
