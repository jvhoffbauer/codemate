- Defines a fixture named `client` using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called when the fixture is invoked in tests. - Inside the function, we first import the Flask application object (`app`) from the specified module (`docs_src.query_params_str_validations.tutorial011_py310`). - We then create a new instance of Flask's built-in test client (`TestClient`) with our application as its argument and store it in the variable `client`. - Finally, we return the `client` object so that it can be used by other functions or classes within our testing suite.
