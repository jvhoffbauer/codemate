- This is a class method of AmisAdmin (presumably), which takes `values` as input and returns modified `values`. - It sets defaults for two configuration options ("amis_image_receiver" and "amis_file_receiver"), both pointing to a URL with the format "POST:<site path>/file/upload". - If neither "database_url" nor "database_url_async" are provided in `values`, it sets "database_url_async" to a SQLite connection string that allows async access.
