- This function, `read_items`, is a GET request handler for the URL path "/items/" in our FastAPI application. - It returns a list of two `Item` objects as JSON response when this endpoint is accessed by clients. - Each `Item` object has three attributes: `name`, `description`, and an optional nested `SubItem`. The latter is represented using a custom model class called `SubItem`.
