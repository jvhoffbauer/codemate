- Tests that making a POST request to `/files/` without a body raises a 422 Unprocessable Entity error with an appropriate JSON response containing a detail dictionary with a single missing field error for the 'file' parameter. - The JSON response is validated using Pytest-mock's mock object `IsDict`, which checks if the response matches the expected structure and content. - The test also includes a fallback case for older versions of Pydantic (v1) where the error message format may differ slightly from newer versions (v2).
