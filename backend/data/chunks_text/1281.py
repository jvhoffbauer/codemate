- Defines an async function `create_file` that takes a parameter `file`, which is annotated with Pydantic's `File` class to validate and parse incoming files. - The `File` class provides metadata about the uploaded file such as its name, content type, size, etc., making it easier for us to handle and process the data. - Inside the function, we extract the length of the byte stream using Python's built-in `len()` function and store it in a dictionary along with the key "file_size". This dictionary will be returned by the function.
