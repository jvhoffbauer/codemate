- Defines a function `test_invalid_simple_tuple` using PyTest's `pytest.fixture` decorator to create a testing environment for our application (FastAPI). - Raises an AssertionError exception when trying to define a route handler that accepts a simple tuple as a parameter, which is not supported by FastAPI. - Demonstrates how to use PyTest's `with` statement and its `raises` context manager to assert expected exceptions during unit tests.
