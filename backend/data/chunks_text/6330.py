- Defines a method `DEFAULT_SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI()` that returns a string representing the default SQLAlchemy database URI for connecting to a PostgreSQL database using AsyncPG adapter. - Uses the `PostgresDsn` class from the `sqlalchemy-url` library to build the connection URL based on the application's default configuration settings such as user name, password, hostname, port number and database name. - Converts the resulting object of type `PostgresURL` returned by `PostgresDsn.build()` into a plain string representation using Python's built-in `str()` function before returning it.
