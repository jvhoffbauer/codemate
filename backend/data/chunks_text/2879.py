- This function is a PUT request handler for updating user information by ID using FastAPI's decorator syntax (@app.put). - It takes two arguments: `user_id`, which is required and passed as part of the URL path (/user/{user_id}), and an optional argument `name` that comes from the request body (Body()). - The database dictionary (db) is retrieved using the get_database dependency resolver (Depends()), which allows us to easily inject dependencies into our functions without having to pass them in manually. - Inside the function, we update the value associated with the given user ID in the database dictionary with the new name provided in the request body. - Finally, we return a simple response message ("OK") indicating success.
