- This function is a GET request handler for the `/items/` endpoint in an application built using FastAPI framework.
- It accepts an optional query parameter `q`, which can be either a string or `None`.
- If `q` is provided, it updates a dictionary called `results` with a new key-value pair containing the value of `q`. The updated dictionary is then returned as the response body. Otherwise, just the original `results` dictionary is returned without any additional keys.
