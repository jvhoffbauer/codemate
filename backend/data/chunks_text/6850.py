- Generates an authentication token for a test user with email `settings.EMAIL_TEST_USER` using the `authentication_token_from_email()` function and returns it as a dictionary of headers to be included in requests made by the Flask-Restful's `TestClient`. - The `normal_user_token_headers()` function is used to provide authenticated access to resources that require authorization for non-admin users during testing. - It helps ensure that tests are executed accurately without requiring actual login credentials or database connections, making them more efficient and reliable.
