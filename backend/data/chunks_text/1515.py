- Defines a GET request for `/items/`.
- Uses FastAPI's dependency injection to pass in a query parameter (`q`) with a default value of `None`.
- Validates and annotates the `q` parameter using Pydantic's `Annotated` decorator, setting its type as either a string or `None`, requiring it to be at least 3 characters long, and providing a custom title and error message through the `Query` class.
- Returns a dictionary containing two items ("Foo" and "Bar"), along with any filtered search results based on the `q` parameter. If no filter is applied, the original dictionary is returned unchanged.
