- Defines a function `create_model_by_fields()` that creates a new Pydantic model based on a list of ModelFields.
- Takes several arguments to customize the behavior and configuration of the generated model, such as the name, field definitions, optional settings like `set_none`, `extra`, and additional keyword arguments passed to the underlying `marshmallow` configurator.
- Returns the newly created model class (a subclass of `pydantic.BaseModel`) with its attributes initialized from the provided list of fields.
