- Creates a new directory named after the specified language (LANG) in the 'docs' folder.
- Checks if the directory already exists and raises an error or aborts execution.
- If the directory doesn't exist yet, creates it using Python's built-in `Path.mkdir()`.
- Writes a configuration file ('mkdocs.yml') to the newly created directory that inherits from the English version of this file.
- Creates a subdirectory called 'docs' inside the new directory and sets up its structure based on the English documentation.
- Copies the content of the index page from the English documentation into the new one, replacing missing translations with a placeholder message.
- Displays a success message and updates the list of supported languages.
