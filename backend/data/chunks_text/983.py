- Defines a function called `copy_field_info` that takes two arguments: `field_info`, which is of type `FieldInfo`, and `annotation`, which can be any Python object (represented by the `Any` type). - The function returns a new instance of `FieldInfo` created using the built-in `copy()` function with the original `field_info` as its argument. This creates a shallow copy of the input `FieldInfo` object, preserving all attributes except for mutable ones like lists or dictionaries. - In summary, this function allows us to create a new `FieldInfo` object with the same properties as another one while avoiding modifying the original object.
