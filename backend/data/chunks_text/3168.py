- Defines a function called `callback_route` that takes no arguments and returns nothing (i.e., has an empty body). - The function is marked with a pragma statement, which tells Python to skip running this function during testing using coverage tools like pytest or unittest. This can be useful for functions that are not essential to test but still need to exist in production code.
