- Defines a fixture named `client` using PyTest's `@pytest.fixture` decorator. - The `get_function()` function is assigned to this fixture, which will be called by PyTest when it encounters this fixture in tests that use it. - Inside the `get_function()`, we first import the Flask application object (`app`) from the specified tutorial file (`docs_src.security.tutorial003_py310`). - We then create a new instance of Flask's built-in test client (`TestClient`) with our imported `app`. - Finally, we return the newly created `client` for use in other functions or classes within our testing suite.
