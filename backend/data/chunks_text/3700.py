- This function tests the `/admin/` endpoint with a custom token for authentication using Pytest and Flask's built-in testing client (TestClient). - The `needs_py39` decorator ensures that this test is only run on Python version 3.9 or higher due to some specific requirements of the application being tested. - If the request is successful, it asserts that the status code is 200 and saves the response text in case further debugging is needed. It also checks if the JSON response contains the expected message.
