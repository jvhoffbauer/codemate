- Defines a custom `ModelWithPath` subclass of `BaseModel`, which has an attribute `path` of type `PurePosixPath`. - Enables support for non-native Python types (such as `PurePosixPath`) by setting `arbitrary_types_allowed` to `True` in version 2 or using a `Config` object with this property set to `True` in version 3. - Tests encoding the resulting object into JSON format, and verifies that the encoded output is equivalent to the expected result.
