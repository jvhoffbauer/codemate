- This function tests the `tutorial001_py39` module in the `docs_src/tutorial` directory using pytest fixtures to clear SQLModel's metadata and provide a custom print function for capturing output. - The `expected_calls` list is not shown, but it likely contains a series of string representations of SQL statements that should be executed during the test. - By checking whether these strings match what was actually printed by the `print` function (which has been replaced by our own mock), we can verify that the database operations are being performed correctly.
