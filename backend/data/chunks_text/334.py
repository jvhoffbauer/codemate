- Defines a function `is_mkdocs_insiders()` that returns a boolean value indicating whether the current installation of mkdocs-material is an insider build or not, using the LRU (Least Recently Used) cache decorator to improve performance by caching the result for future calls with similar arguments. - Retrieves the version number of mkdocs-material using the `metadata.version()` function and checks if it contains the string 'insiders'. This can be used to provide different functionality or behavior based on whether the user has installed the latest development builds or the stable release.
