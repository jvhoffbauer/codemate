- Tests that sending a request with an invalid JSON body results in a HTTP status code of 422 and an appropriate error message from Django Rest Framework's validation system using Pytest and Pydantic for schema validation. - The `IsDict` type hint is used to ensure that the expected error format is adhered to by the DRF validator. - A comment is included indicating that this check will be removed once Pydantic version 1 is no longer supported.
