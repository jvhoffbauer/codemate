- Retrieves a specific form item based on a requested model field and an update action using `self.get_form_item()`.
- Checks whether the retrieved item is either a dictionary or a subclass of `BaseModel`, returning `None` otherwise.
- If the item is a `BaseModel` instance, converts it to a dictionary with some fields excluded and others included explicitly.
- Adds a new key-value pair called `saveImmediately` to the resulting dictionary.
- For switch type items, adds another key-value pair called `mode` with value `inline`.
- Returns the modified dictionary as the result.
