- This endpoint raises a `HTTPException` with status code 204 (No Content), which indicates that the server successfully processed the request but is not returning any content in the response body. - The use of this exception helps to provide clear and consistent error handling for cases where there is no data to return, rather than relying on more ambiguous responses like empty bodies or 200 OK codes without payloads.
