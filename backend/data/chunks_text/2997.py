- This function is a GET request handler for the `"/router-depends/"` endpoint, defined using FastAPI's built-in dependency injection system (`Depends`) to pass in a dictionary of common parameters called `commons`. - The returned JSON response contains two keys: 'in', which indicates that this route depends on other routes or dependencies, and 'params', which holds the value of the `commons` parameter passed into the function via dependency injection.
