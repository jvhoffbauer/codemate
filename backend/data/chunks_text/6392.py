- Defines a function `decorator` that takes an object as input and returns it after performing some operations.
- Checks whether the input object is a subclass of `BaseModel`. If not, raises an AssertionError.
- Creates a dictionary called `opts` containing various attributes such as `__base__`, `__module__`, and fields' names and their corresponding types.
- Removes the current class itself from the list of bases using slicing syntax.
- Adds the configuration options to the dictionary if they exist.
- Uses the `create_model` function to recreate the original model with the updated options.
- Assigns the new model back to the variable `obj`.
- Sets the module attribute of the new model based on the provided value.
- Stores the newly created model along with its name and module in a dictionary called `components`.
- Returns the stored component instead of creating a new one every time this decorator is used. This helps avoid redundant computations and improves performance by caching previously computed results.
