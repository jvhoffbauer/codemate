- Defines a function `is_scalar_field` that takes a single argument, `ModelField`.
- The function returns True if the field is a scalar field as defined by `is_pv1_scalar_field`, and False otherwise.
- This function can be used to check whether a given Django model field represents a simple value (such as an integer or string), rather than a more complex object like a foreign key or many-to-many relationship.
