- Defines an asynchronous function `update_item` that takes two arguments: `item_id` and `item`. The latter is bound to the request body using FastAPI's `Body()` decorator with a default value of type `Item`, which is embedded in the JSON response. - Inside the function, creates a dictionary called `results` containing both the `item_id` and the `item` object passed through the request body. - Returns the `results` dictionary.
