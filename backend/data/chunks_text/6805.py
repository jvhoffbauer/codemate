- Retrieves an item with a specific ID from the database using SQLAlchemy's `Session`.
- Raises a `HTTPException` with status code 404 if the item is not found in the database.
- Checks whether the user has sufficient permissions to access the item based on its owner ID and their own user ID. If they are not authorized, raises another `HTTPException` with status code 400. Otherwise, returns the requested item as defined by the `ItemOut` schema.
