- Imports `tutorial004_py310` module from the `docs_src.tutorial.select` package and assigns it to a variable named `mod`.
- Sets the value of `mod.sqlite_url` to a SQLAlchemy URL for an in-memory SQLite database.
- Creates a SQLAlchemy engine using the `create_engine()` function, passing in the `mod.sqlite_url` string.
- Initializes a list called `calls` that will be used later to verify that certain functions were called during testing.
- Retrieves the built-in Python print function (which is replaced by a mock object during tests), saves its original behavior in a variable called `new_print`, and replaces the built-in print function with a custom implementation that adds each printed message to the `calls` list instead of actually printing them.
- Calls the `main()` method of the `mod` module inside a context manager that patches the built-in print function with our custom implementation. This allows us to capture all output generated by the `main()` method without actually displaying it on the console.
- After executing the `main()` method, checks whether the expected methods were called during execution using the `check_calls()` function provided by Pytest's `mock` plugin. If any unexpected methods are called or if some expected ones aren't called, this function raises an AssertionError exception.
