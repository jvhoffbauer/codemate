- This function is a GET request for retrieving a specific hero by ID using FastAPI's decorator `@app.get`.
- The parameter `hero_id` is passed in and converted to an integer type.
- A database connection is established using SQLAlchemy's `Session()` method.
- The `session.get()` method is used to retrieve the specified hero from the database based on its primary key (ID).
- If the hero is not found, a customized HTTP exception is raised with status code 404 and error message "Hero not found".
- Otherwise, the hero object is returned as the response body.
