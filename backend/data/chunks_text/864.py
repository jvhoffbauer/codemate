- Defines an async context manager that wraps another context manager and executes it in a thread from the `anyio.threads` module using the `run_in_threadpool()` function. - The `ContextManagerInThreadPool` decorator allows us to define our custom context managers with threads by wrapping them inside this decorator. - This implementation ensures that the `__exit__()` method of the wrapped context manager runs synchronously within the same thread where it was entered, avoiding potential deadlock issues caused by concurrent access to shared resources or other context managers with their own internal thread pools.
