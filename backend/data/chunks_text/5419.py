- Defines an endpoint for reading a MosaicJSON using FastAPI's `@app.get()` decorator and specifies its URL path (`/`)
- Specifies that the response should be in the format of a `MosaicJSON`, which is defined elsewhere in the application
- Excludes None values from being included in the JSON response by setting `response_model_exclude_none=True`
- Provides detailed documentation about what the endpoint returns through the `responses` dictionary, where each key represents an HTTP status code and its corresponding value contains a description
- Dependencies are passed to the function using keyword arguments, including the file path (`src_path`), backend parameters (`backend_params`), reader parameters (`reader_params`), and environment variables (`env`)
- Uses the `rasterio.Env` context manager to set up the necessary environment variables for working with geospatial data, passing them down to other functions via keyword arguments
- Creates a new instance of the dataset reader class (`self.reader`) using the specified file path and options, and passes it along with any required backend parameters to the `with` statement to execute the operation within a resource management context
