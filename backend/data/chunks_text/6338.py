- Creates a new asynchronous event loop using `asyncio.new_event_loop()`.
- Sets this newly created event loop as the default one for the current thread using `asyncio.set_event_Loop()`.
- Yields control back to the caller, allowing other coroutines or tasks to run on the same event loop.
- Closes the event loop when all coroutines and tasks have completed execution using `loop.close()`.
