- This function creates a new hero and saves it to the database using FastAPI's dependency injection mechanism (`Depends`) with SQLAlchemy as the ORM. - The `create_hero` function takes two arguments, `session` which is an instance of the current database connection obtained from `get_session`, and `hero` which is the data that will be used to create the new hero object. - After validating the input data using SQLAlchemy's `ModelValidate` method, the new hero object is added to the session, committed, and refreshed before returning it in JSON format using FastAPI's `response_model`.
