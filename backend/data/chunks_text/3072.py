- Tests if `GET /b/override` returns expected content and header values using Flask's built-in testing client. - Uses a context manager to ensure that resources are properly released after the test is complete. - Asserts that the returned content matches the expected value (`b"Hello B"`) and checks the Content-Type header for correctness (`html_type`, assumed to be defined elsewhere).
