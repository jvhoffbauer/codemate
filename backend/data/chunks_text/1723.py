- This function is a GET request for an individual item with the specified `item_id`.
- The `Path` decorator extracts the `item_id` from the URL path and passes it as a parameter to the function.
- The `Query` decorator allows for optional query parameters (in this case, `q`) that can be passed in the URL query string. These are also passed as arguments to the function.
- The function returns a dictionary containing both the requested item ID and any provided query parameters.
