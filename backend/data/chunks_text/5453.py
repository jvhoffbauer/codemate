- Creates a `MosaicTilerFactory` instance with a custom file backend and passes in a dictionary of parameters for the backend (`BackendParams`) as a dependency. - Registers the resulting tile server router with FastAPI using the `include_router` method. - Uses the `tmpmosaic` context manager to generate a temporary mosaic file URL that is passed into the GET request for the TileJSON endpoint.
