- Defines a new endpoint `withdraw()` for the API version 1 using FastAPI's decorator syntax.
- Specifies that this method should raise an error called `NotEnoughMoney` if certain conditions are not met (i.e., insufficient funds in the user's account).
- Accepts two arguments: `account`, which is retrieved from the database using the `Depends` function and passed to the method as a parameter; and `amount`, which is obtained through the request body using Pydantic's `Body` field validators. The `gt` argument ensures that the value of `amount` is greater than zero, while the `example` argument provides a default value for testing purposes.
- Calculates whether there are enough funds available by subtracting the requested withdrawal amount from the current balance. If the result is less than zero, it raises the previously defined `NotEnoughMoney` exception with additional context about the remaining balance. Otherwise, updates the account's balance and returns the updated value.
