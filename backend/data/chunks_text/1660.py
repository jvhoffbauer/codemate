- This function is a FastAPI route with the `GET` method and endpoint `/items/`.
- It takes a dependency injection of `CommonQueryParams`, which provides query parameters like `q`, `skip`, and `limit`.
- The function returns a dictionary called `response` that contains two keys, 'q' (if present in the query params) and 'items', which are fetched from a mock database using the values of `skip` and `limit` provided by `CommonsQueryParams`.
