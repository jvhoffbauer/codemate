- This function is called `login_access_token`, and it's responsible for generating a new access token when a user logs in using their credentials (email and password). - It takes two dependencies as arguments: `Session` from SQLAlchemy to interact with the database, and `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm` which contains the username and password provided by the client during authentication. - The function calls the `crud.user.authenticate` method to verify that the user exists and has entered the correct credentials. If the user doesn't exist or has incorrect credentials, it raises a `HTTPException`. - If the user is active, the function creates a new access token using `security.create_access_token` and returns it along with the token type ("Bearer").
