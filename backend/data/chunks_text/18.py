- This method is called when an attribute is deleted from a class using del statement. - It checks whether the current class is a subclass of SQLAlchemy's declarative base or not. - If it is, then it calls the corresponding method in the parent class (DeclarativeMeta). Otherwise, it delegates to the superclass implementation.
