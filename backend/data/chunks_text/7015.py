- Retrieves an item with a specific ID using FastAPI's dependency injection system to pass in the `get_item()` function from CRUD operations and the current authenticated user from `get_current_active_user()`. - Checks whether the requesting user has sufficient privileges to access the requested item based on its owner ID and their own role as determined by the `crud.user.is_superuser()` helper method. - Raises a customized HTTP exception with status code 400 and error message "Not enough permissions." if the user is not authorized to view the item.
