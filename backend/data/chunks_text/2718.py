- Defines a function called `no_response_model_annotation_forward_ref_list_of_model` that returns a list of `DBUser` objects without using response model annotations or forward references to them. - The returned list contains two instances of `DBUser`, each with a name, surname, and hashed password. - This implementation is useful in situations where you want to avoid circular imports between models and views/controllers by defining the view's data outside of it.
