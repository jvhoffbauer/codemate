- Tests if Flask-Orjson can handle non-string keys in JSON responses using a GET request to `/orjson_non_str_keys`. - Uses the `client` object provided by Flask's testing framework to simulate an HTTP request and retrieve the response. - Asserts that the decoded JSON response contains the expected key-value pairs, including a non-string key (`"1"`).
