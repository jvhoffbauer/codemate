- Defines a function `get_schema_from_model_field()` which takes several arguments related to models and schemas generation. - The function returns a dictionary containing JSON Schema values for a specific model field based on its configuration (e.g., validation or serialization). - It uses another helper function called `field_schema()`, provided by the `marshmallow-json-schema` library, to extract the actual schema definition from the given model field. - By default, it separates input and output schemas if `separate_input_output_schemas` is set to true; otherwise, it combines them into a single schema.
