- Defines a function `get_sync_context_b` that takes an optional argument `state`, which is obtained using the dependency resolver `Depends`. The default value for this argument is provided by another function called `context_b`. - Returns the value of the `state` parameter, which can be used to pass data between functions in a synchronous context (i.e., not asynchronously). This pattern allows for sharing information across multiple functions without having to explicitly pass it around as arguments or store it in global variables.
