- This function is a pre-processing step that runs before an update operation is executed in Pydantic's ORM (Object Relational Mapping). - It takes several arguments including `request`, `obj`, and `item_id`. These represent the incoming request, the updated object being saved to the database, and the ID of the item being updated respectively. - The function returns a dictionary called `data` which contains only the fields with non-null values or those allowed to be null based on their model definitions using `field_allow_none` and `model_fields`. - By excluding unset fields and returning this modified dictionary instead of the original `obj`, we can ensure that our application handles updates more efficiently while still maintaining data integrity.
