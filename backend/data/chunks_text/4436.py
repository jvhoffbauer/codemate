- Generates an OpenAPI v3.1 JSON schema for a FastAPI application using `client.get("/openapi.json")`.
- The generated schema includes information about the API's title, version, and paths (e.g., GET requests to retrieve items).
- The schema also defines error responses, such as HTTPValidationErrors with detailed validation errors.
- Header parameters are included in the request definitions, allowing clients to provide authentication or other contextual data.
