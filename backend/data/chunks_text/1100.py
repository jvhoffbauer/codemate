- Mimics the functionality of Flask-JWT-Extended's `jwt_required()` decorator by returning a user object based on the provided JWT token. - Provides no actual security as it uses a dummy database and implementation for decoding tokens. - Introduces a placeholder function to test the integration with Flask-Login in future versions without requiring an external library like Flask-JWT-Extended.
