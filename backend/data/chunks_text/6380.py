- This middleware logs incoming and outgoing JSON RPC requests to a logger object named 'logger'. - The request is logged as a dictionary using string formatting with the 'raw_request' attribute of the context object passed in by the framework. - The response is also logged similarly after executing the main logic inside the 'yield' statement, which allows other middlewares or handlers to run before returning the final result.
