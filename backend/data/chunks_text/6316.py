1. This function retrieves the current authenticated user from a database using FastAPI's dependency injection and SQLAlchemy ORM. It takes two dependencies as arguments - `AsyncSession` obtained by calling `get_session`, which is used to interact with the database, and an OAuth2 access token obtained by calling `reusable_oauth2`. The function returns the currently logged in user object of type `User`.
2. If the provided token is invalid, the function raises a `HTTPException` with appropriate error message. Otherwise, it decodes the token using PyJWT library and extracts necessary information such as sub (subject) and issuer time.
3. Using the extracted data, the function queries the database for the corresponding user record based on the subject ID. If the user is not found, another `HTTPException` is raised. Finally, the function returns the fetched user object.
