1. This function is a method of an asynchronous class called `APIResource`. It's triggered when a list operation (e.g., GET /items/) completes successfully and returns a `Result` object containing the response body.
2. The function takes several arguments including the original request, the parsed result, and a schema used to validate the input/output format. It also accepts keyword arguments passed by other methods that call this one.
3. Inside the function, we first retrieve the list of fields that should be excluded from the output using another asynchronous method `get_deny_fields()`, which checks whether the user has permission to access those fields based on some criteria (not shown here).
4. We then invoke the parent implementation of `on_list_after()` to perform any default processing before returning the modified list with filtered items. Note that we use the `async` and `await` keywords because Pydantic supports coroutines since version 1.8.
