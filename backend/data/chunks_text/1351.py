- Defines an asynchronous function `read_items()` that takes a default optional argument `user_agent`.
- The value of this argument is set using the built-in `Header` class, which allows for easy handling of missing or empty values.
- If no value is provided, the header will not be included in the request; otherwise, it will be added to the headers dictionary returned by the function.
