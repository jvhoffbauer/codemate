- This method is an asynchronous function that returns a byte array (bytes). - It checks whether the `_body` attribute exists on the current object. If it doesn't exist, it retrieves the body from its parent class using `super().body()`. - The method then decompresses the body if the Content-Encoding header contains 'gzip'. - Finally, it sets the `_body` attribute to the decompressed or original body and returns it.
