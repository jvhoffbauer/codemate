- Defines a function `get_current_superuser()` that takes an optional argument `current_user`, which is retrieved using the `Depends` decorator and passed to the `get_current_user()` function from FastAPI's built-in authentication middleware (JWT or OAuth2). - Checks whether the current user has superuser privilege by calling the `is_superuser()` method on it. If the user is not a superuser, raises a custom HTTP exception with a status code of 403 ("Forbidden") and a detailed error message explaining why access is denied. - Returns the current user object itself if it passes the privilege check. This allows chaining multiple authorization checks in subsequent functions without having to pass the same arguments repeatedly.
