- This endpoint uses the `Depends` function to pass a generator function as an argument, which is used to generate dependency objects dynamically at runtime. - The `state` parameter is passed to the generator function and checked for a specific value using an assert statement. - If the condition is met, the `OtherDependencyError` exception is raised instead of returning a response, demonstrating how FastAPI can handle synchronous exceptions in generators.
