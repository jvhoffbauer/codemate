- Closes the globally shared `aiohttp.ClientSession` object using an asynchronous context manager (`async with`) or by calling its `close()` method synchronously. - Logs a message indicating that the session is being closed for informational purposes. - Uses a global variable to store and access the client session, which can be reused across multiple requests instead of creating new sessions each time. This improves performance and reduces resource usage in applications making many concurrent HTTP requests.
