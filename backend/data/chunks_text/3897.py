- This test case checks if passing a query parameter with a hyphenated name ("item-query") and value ("fixedquery") in the GET request to the "/items/" endpoint returns expected results. - The `test_query_params_str_validations_item_query_fixedquery` function is tested using the `TestClient` class from Pytest's built-in fixture, which allows us to simulate HTTP requests against our Flask app without starting an actual server process. - If the test passes, the API should return a JSON response containing both items that match the fixedquery filter (i.e., "Foo" and "Bar"), as well as the original query string passed in the URL parameters.
