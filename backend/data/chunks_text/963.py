- This function `serialize_sequence_value()` takes two arguments - a model field and a value to be serialized. It returns a sequence of values that can be used for serialization purposes.
- The function first retrieves the original data type of the annotation associated with the given field using `get_origin()`. If this fails, it falls back to using the raw annotation instead.
- The function then checks if the original data type is a subclass of Python's built-in sequence types like list, tuple, etc., using the `issubclass()` method.
- Finally, the function uses a dictionary called `sequence_annotation_to_type` to convert the original sequence into a new one based on its annotation. This conversion is done by calling the corresponding constructor from the `collections.abc` module, which provides abstract base classes for various container types in Python. In our case, we are interested in sequences, so we use `Sequence` as the key for our dictionary. Note that we have to suppress some mypy warnings here because the exact type of the returned value may vary depending on the specific sequence type being converted.
