- Defines an asynchronous function named `ws_dependency_validate` with a positional argument `x_missing`, which is assigned to the `Header` class from the standard library's `httpx` module by default if not provided. - The function body consists of a single empty line (pass statement) and a docstring that indicates it should be skipped during testing due to lack of coverage. This suggests that this function may serve as a placeholder or stub for future implementation, but currently has no functionality beyond serving as a dependency validation checkpoint in some context where WebSocket messages are being processed.
