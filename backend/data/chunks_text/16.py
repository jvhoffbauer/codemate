- Defines a function called `Relationship` that takes optional arguments for configuring relationships between SQLAlchemy models and other objects (such as lists or dictionaries). - Returns an object of type `RelationshipInfo`, which contains information about the relationship configuration. - Allows customization of various aspects of the relationship through its argument options, such as specifying the name of the attribute to use for populating related data ("back_populates"), defining a custom intermediate model ("link_model"), and passing additional parameters to the underlying SQLAlchemy `RelationshipProperty`.
