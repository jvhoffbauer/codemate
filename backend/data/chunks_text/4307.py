- Tests Flask application middleware by creating a `TestClient` object with and without specifying the base URL for HTTP requests. - Verifies that the root endpoint returns an expected status code (200 OK). - Confirms that a redirect is handled correctly using the `follow_redirects` parameter of the `get()` method. The location header of the initial request is also checked to ensure it matches the expected value.
