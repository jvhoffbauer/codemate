- Tests if a request to `/b/a/override` returns expected content and header values using Flask's built-in testing client. - Uses the `client` context manager provided by Flask to automatically close the connection after each test case execution, ensuring resources are released properly. - Asserts that the returned content is equal to "Hello B A", which indicates successful override of the default route for `/a`. - Verifies that the correct Content-Type header value (HTML) is included in the response headers.
