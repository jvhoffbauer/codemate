- This function generates a single map tile based on user input parameters such as zoom level, column and row coordinates, output format, and optional processing steps like buffering, rescaling, applying color formulas, and changing colormaps. - The function uses the rio library for reading and manipulating GeoTIFF files, which allows for efficient handling of large datasets. - The function supports various output formats including JPEG and PNG, depending on whether there is an alpha channel in the resulting image. - The function provides default values for some parameters, making it easy to use without specifying all options. - The function integrates well with other FastAPI dependencies for managing paths, layers, datasets, environments, and processes.
