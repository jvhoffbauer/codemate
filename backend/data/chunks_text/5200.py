1. This function takes a GeoJSON object (either a single feature or a collection) as input through the `geojson` parameter. It also accepts several dependency functions that provide various parameters required by other libraries used in this function. These dependencies are passed using the `Depends()` decorator provided by FastAPI.
2. The function checks whether the input is a single feature or a collection, and converts it into a collection if necessary.
3. Using the `rasterio.Env()` context manager, the function opens the source file specified by the `src_path` parameter using the `self.reader()` method, which returns an open RasterIO dataset.
4. If no asset selection is provided via the `layer_params.assets` parameter, the function uses all available assets from the opened dataset. Otherwise, it applies the selected expression using the `self.expression()` method.
5. For each feature in the collection, the function extracts its geometry and passes it along with the relevant parameters to the `src_dst.feature()` method, which returns a NumPy array representing the corresponding values within the extracted region.
6. The function then calculates statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, etc., on these arrays using the `get_array_statistics()` helper function, passing any additional parameters provided via the `stats_params` and `histogram_params`.
7. Finally, the calculated statistics are added to the properties dictionary of the feature, overwriting existing ones if present. The resulting modified features are returned either individually (if the original input was a single feature) or as a collection.
