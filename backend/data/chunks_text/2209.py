- Defines a new endpoint `/tocallback` using FastAPI's decorator syntax
- Specifies that the expected request body should be two instances of type `Item`, and returns an array of those items as the response (using Pydantic's model validation)
- Includes a customized HTTP status code for error handling (in this case, returning a list of messages instead of the default JSON representation), which is defined in the `responses` dictionary argument to the decorator
