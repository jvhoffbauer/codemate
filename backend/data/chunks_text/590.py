- This function, `test_tutorial`, is a unit test that calls another function called `test_create_hero` from the module `test_mod`. - The purpose of this unit test is to verify that the `test_create_hero` function in `test_mod` works as expected and creates a hero successfully. - If the `test_create_hero` function passes all its tests, then `test_tutorial` will also pass; otherwise, it will fail.
