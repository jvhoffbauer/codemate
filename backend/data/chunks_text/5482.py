- Mocks `rasterio.open()` function using Python's built-in unittest.mock module (`unittest.mock`) to replace its original behavior with a custom implementation during testing. - Sends an HTTP GET request to the `/point` endpoint of the application passing in coordinates and URL as query parameters. - Asserts that the server returns a successful HTTP status code (200) and sets the content type header to JSON format. - Parses the response body into a dictionary and checks if it contains the expected coordinates.
