- Defines a function called `response_model_model1_annotation_model2_return_same_model` that returns an instance of the `Item` class, which is annotated with two models (`Model1` and `Model2`) as its type hints. - The returned object is an instance of the `User` model, which has attributes 'name' and'surname'. This example demonstrates how to define a custom response schema using Pydantic by returning an instance of a specific model from a FastAPI endpoint. In this case, both `Model1` and `Model2` are used in the type hints for the function signature, but since they represent the same underlying model (i.e., `User`), we can still safely return an instance of that model without any issues or conflicts.
