- Defines a function `get_current_user()` that takes an optional argument `token`.
- If no token is provided, raises an exception with specific details and headers.
- Decodes the token using the secret key and algorithm specified in the configuration.
- Extracts the username from the decoded payload and creates a new object containing it.
- Raises another exception if the username cannot be found or extracted.
- Retrieves the user from a fake database based on the username stored in the token data.
- Returns the user if found; otherwise, raises an exception again.
